I found out about the death of [Joe Armstrong](https://joearms.github.io/#Index), the father of Erlang, recently as did the world.

> It is with great sadness that I share news of Joe Armstrong's passing away earlier today. Whilst he may no longer be with us, his work has laid the foundation which will be used by generations to come. RIP [@joeerl](https://twitter.com/joeerl?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw), thank you for inspiring us all.

I did find this very interesting and applicable quote to all developers. We can take guidance. ![Spf13 2019 Apr 23](/assets/img/2019/04/spf13_2019-Apr-23.jpg "spf13_2019-Apr-23.jpg")
