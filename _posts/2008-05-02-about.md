I am not a technologist totally by accident but close enough to call my blog Accidental Technologist. I started my career as a Chemical Engineer but switched my major on what seemed like a whim. So, here I am a computer scientist.

I am a freelance web developer, Internet Systems Architect and entreprenuer living in Woodstock, CT. I have been writing software for the better part of 20 years in languages such as Ruby, BASIC, C/C++, Visual Basic, ASP/ASP.NET and C#. I ran a software development and network integration company for 10 years and then sold the business to move on to other interests.

Today I create and maintain web applications using Ruby on Rails and ASP.NET. I have a growing interest and experience with the relatively new ASP.NET MVC Framework. ASP.NET MVC moves Microsoft development forward, mirroring Ruby on Rails in many ways. The mix of applications I have written using ASP.NET and Ruby on Rails ranges from utility application to full-blown ecommerce systems. One of my personal applications is over at [www.toreadlist.com](http://www.toreadlist.com/) and is a little site to keep track of what you want to read next, like a book mark for the web but not like Del.icio.us or a bookmark in your browser. Check it out and see what I mean.

My Ruby and Ruby on Rails work started in early 2007, I had been working on ASP.NET and was looking to expand my set of developer tools while being able to create applications faster than with traditional ASP.NET tools. I have interest in many different computer languages, exploring Scala, Python and almost anything dynamic.

I maintain the open source project known as [Instant Rails](http://rubyforge.org/projects/instantrails/) project over on RubyForge and write a bit of code for [TrackDailyGoals.com](http://trackdailygoals.com/team). I also am a Ruby Community Editor for the great site, [www.infoq.com](http://www.infoq.com/), since June 2007. My InfoQ writings can be [found on my authors page](http://www.infoq.com/author/Robert-Bazinet).

My professional work includes running a web development consultancy called [The Still River Software Company, LLC](http://stillriversoftware.com). We are primarily provide Ruby and Ruby on Rails software development services and are introducing our first software product for tracking customer complaints called [CustomerFu](http://customerfu.com).

I am available for hire on freelance projects, contact me about your project at **rbazinet at gmail dot com**. The most recent copy of my resume can be [found here.](/files/RobBazinetResume062009.pdf "resume")

My other interests include backpacking in the White Mountains and flying [High Power Rocketry](http://www.tripoli.org/) in and around New England.
