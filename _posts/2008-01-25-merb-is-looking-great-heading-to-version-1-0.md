[![merb_header_logo](http://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/merb-header-logo-thumb.png) Merb](http://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/merb-header-logo.png) development is coming along at a really fast pace and the team has really thought out the architecture implemented in Merb 1.0. I am personally excited to see these updates coming. The new Merb-core gem is small and fast, allowing developers to create small applications without a large overhead, much like [Camping](http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping/), but with a richer, more complete framework.

My [latest article is up on InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/01/road-to-merb) talking about the latest Merb developments with Ezra Zygmuntowicz, Merb creator and founder of the [Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com/).

As you read through the interview, understand an important point by Ezra:

> Merb is a web application framework with many similarities to Rails. The main difference is a focus on understandable, non-magic, fast code.

I think this is important for Merb as well as future Ruby frameworks, Ruby on Rails is the current killer application for Ruby. Rails is the pioneer in Ruby web frameworks <u>but</u> it is not without faults. Any pioneer knows there will be followers who imitate and duplicate their efforts to leverage their strengths and improve on their weaknesses. In my opinion, Merb is a perfect example. The Merb team decided what they did not like in Rails and created their own framework and avoided those problems, a perfect example of evolution in action.

I think we will see many Ruby frameworks looking to improve on Rails, improve on Merb and create better and better technology. This is certainly exciting times in Ruby web development.
