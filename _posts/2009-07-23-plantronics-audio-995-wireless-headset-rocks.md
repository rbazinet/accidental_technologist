I find myself using Skype more and more for both conversations with other Skype users or for taking advantage of the SkypeOut service so I can call any landline phone. I have been using a [Logitech ClearChat Pro USB Headset](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-ClearChat-Pro-USB-Headset/dp/B000TG4AGU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1248370009&sr=8-2), wired version, for the past 6 months. Overall the headset worked just fine but I had a nagging issue that I could not do anything about, the cord. I seem to keep running over the cord and pinning to the floor with my office chair. This is pretty annoying when I try to move only to have the headset ripped off my head or my head pulled to the side because I ran out of cord. I do this all the time and it just got plain annoying.

So I decided to look for a wireless headset. I started digging around Amazon?s website and thought I could find something with Bluetooth that would fit the need but it seems the previous model from Plantronics I had considered was discontinued. I narrowed my search down to the [Logitech ClearChat Wireless USB Headset](http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-ClearChat-Wireless-USB-Headset/dp/B0015EY5RE/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1248370009&sr=8-5) and the [Plantronics .Audio 995 Wireless USB Headset](http://www.plantronics.com/north_america/en_US/products/computer/multi-use-headsets/audio-995), both priced about the same.

The decision came down to determining what other aspects of my current headset I might change, if I went with Plantronics. The only other real feature I would change is the size of the earphones, the Plantronics has much larger ones than the Logitech. The Plantronics also mutes the microphone when it is raised up, another really nice feature.

So, I purchased the [Plantronics .Audio 995 Wireless USB Headset](http://www.plantronics.com/north_america/en_US/products/computer/multi-use-headsets/audio-995) from [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Plantronics-Audio-995-Wireless-Headset/dp/B001SEQN3U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1248360875&sr=8-1). Beyond the features I mentioned I liked there is also a couple other nice ones like the range, 40?, longer than the Logitech.

Great set of features from the Plantronics web site:

- Dual 40mm speakers deliver full-range stereo sound
- Wireless connection with 40-foot range
- On-ear controls for volume adjustment and controlling tracks on iTunes and Windows Media Player
- Noise-canceling microphone with Fast Mic Mute feature that automatically mutes the sound when the boom is raised
- Easy plug-and-play setup; no software required
- One-year limited warranty
 
After getting the headset and setting it up on my PC I have to say I made the right decision. The fit is so much better than the Logitech set I own and the sound quality is great over Skype or listening to anything in iTunes. Recent conversations over Skype were very clear and seem to be better than the wired set.

The ability to roam around the office is a huge benefit, no more running over wires. The only real unknown to me at this time is how long I have between charges but I guess I will figure it out.

### Finally

This is a great headset and I really love the features in this headset, particularly:

- The range ? 40?
- Ease of setup ? just plug it in
- Comfort ? nice and big for the ears, not tight on the head
- Wireless ? enough said
 
I would recommend these to anyone looking for a wireless headset.
