So, I have my new iPhone in my hot little hands and crack open the beautifully designed box from Apple to look at the instructions. The basic instructions are (8) 2" x 4" pages with very little writing and some pictures. How hard could it be to get this thing working?

Well, obviously much longer than I expected otherwise I probably wouldn't be writing this post. The instructions are as follows:

1. Download and install the latest version of iTunes.
2. Connect iPhone to your Mac or PC using the included cable and Dock.
3. Follow the onscreen instructions in iTunes to activate iPhone and sync your contacts, calendars, email accounts, bookmarks, music, photos, videos, and more.

That's it. That's all there is to it....yeah right.

I was already using iTunes with my older iPod and it has worked great. I am on Windows Vista (32-bit) and running iTunes 7.4.3.1, which is the latest at the time of writing this. I plugged in the iPhone Dock to the USB cable back to a USB 2.0 port and sat the iPhone in the dock with iTunes running.....nothing. After several failed attempts of unplugging the USB, connecting with iTunes closed and different USB ports but still nothing worked.

Thinking I may have received a dead iPhone, I unpacked my MacBook Pro and tried the same combination and it worked just fine and I was able to activate my iPhone with AT &amp; T with no problems. I still had the issue of using the iPhone with Vista since I use Windows for my day-to-day work and the bulk of my media content resides on Vista I really needed to get it to work. So off to Google I went....

It turns out this not a uncommon problem on Windows at all. The first article for the iPhone on Apple's support web site is titled "[iPhone not recognized in iTunes for Windows](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305716)". This article is a good place to start but did not solve my problem. At the bottom of the article it basically says if all else fails the reinstall. Apple does give some nice [detailed instructions about uninstalling iTunes](http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305409).

The article says to try the following:

I tried just uninstalling iTunes as instructed about but this did not work, so I followed all the steps including removal of QuickTime and also confirming all directories were gone as well.

The last piece of the puzzle was probably the root cause of the problem. It seems Vista does a lousy job of installing various USB drivers and in this case the one for the Apple USB. I needed to delete the folder beginning with USBAPPL\_ in the C:\\Windows\\System32\\DRVSTORE.

I then reran the iTunes setup, [as Administrator](http://cdevroe.com/notes/vista-iphone/), rebooted and tried the iPhone connection again and it all worked.

I hope this save someone from a headache or two and about 2 hours of time.
