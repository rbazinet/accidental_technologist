The moment has finally arrived, [Microsoft released their first CTP of the MVC Framework](https://asp.net/downloads/3.5-extensions/). I am very anxious to get some time to start working with the bits they are releasing today.

I plan to get heavily into this framework and will post some tidbits of how it works, but in the meantime here are links to some interesting content from some people who know about the MVC Framework.

Scott Guthrie has a couple nice posts on using the framework from the past couple weeks:

- [ASP.NET MVC Framework (Part 1)](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/11/13/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-1.aspx)
- [ASP.NET MVC Framework (Part 2): URL Routing](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/03/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-2-url-routing.aspx)
- [ASP.NET MVC Framework (Part 3): Passing ViewData from Controllers to Views](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/06/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-3-passing-viewdata-from-controllers-to-views.aspx)
- [ASP.NET MVC Framework (Part 4): Handling Form Edit and Post Scenarios](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/12/09/asp-net-mvc-framework-part-4-handling-form-edit-and-post-scenarios.aspx)
- [ScottGu MVC Presentation and ScottHa Screencast from ALT.NET Conference](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottGuMVCPresentationAndScottHaScreencastFromALTNETConference.aspx)

Rob Conery, who joined Microsoft recently, also posted about his work on the MVC team:

- [ASP.NET MVC Preview: Using The MVC UI Helpers](https://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/12/05/aspnet-mvc-preview-using-the-mvc-ui-helpers/)
- [ASP.NET MVC: Using RESTful Architecture](https://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/12/06/aspnet-mvc-using-restful-architecture/)

Jeffery Palermo has been active working on the framework:

- [ASP.NET MVC and the Future of Model View Presenter : Interview with Jeffery Palermo](https://polymorphicpodcast.com/shows/aspnetmvc/)
- [Use the ASP.NET MVC Framework to Write Web Apps without Viewstate or Postbacks from Code Magazine](https://www.code-magazine.com/Article.aspx?quickid=070173)

Rick Strahl provides some insight about his take on the MVC Framework:

- [What's Ailing ASP.NET Web Forms](https://west-wind.com/WebLog/posts/198731.aspx)

Phil Haack was also recently hired by Microsoft and post some interesting MVC related items:

- [TDD and Dependency Injection with ASP.NET MVC](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/12/07/tdd-and-dependency-injection-with-asp.net-mvc.aspx)
- [Extending ASP.NET MVC To Add Conventions](https://haacked.com/archive/2007/12/09/extending-asp.net-mvc-to-add-conventions.aspx)

Microsoft has started an open source project on CodePlex for those wanting to contribute to the ASP.NET MVC Framework, called [MVC Contrib](https://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib). Also, to get everyone started are some [Quickstarts](https://quickstarts.asp.net/3-5-extensions/).

**UPDATE:** Thanks to Jeffrey Palermo for setting me straight, the MVC Contrib project was started by Jeffrey and Eric Hexter. It is a project independent of Microsoft.
