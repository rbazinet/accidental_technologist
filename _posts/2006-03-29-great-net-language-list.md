I have fascination with computer languages as some people do with foreign languages. In searching around for Ruby implementations on .NET I found this [list of the available languages](https://devel.oping.net/content/all-net-languages-list.aspx) ported or developed for .NET. It's really quite impressive to see so many available, some I had heard of but others not. I don't know how exhaustive this list is but it's very interesting.
