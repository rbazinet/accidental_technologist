It seems more and more web sites are offering users to subscribe to updates delivered by email. ?If you would rather have posts delivered right to your inbox instead of visiting the site or relying on RSS, you can now subscribe and forget.

Just add your email to the ?Subscribe to Blog via Email?, submit and confirm your desire to subscribe in the confirmation email and thats it. ?You can unsubscribe any time.
