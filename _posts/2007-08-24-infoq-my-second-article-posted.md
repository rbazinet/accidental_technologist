Since signing on with [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com) as a .NET editor I have had my [second article posted](http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/08/codesmith-plinqo).

I had the great opportunity to chat with Eric J. Smith of [CodeSmith Tools, LLC](https://www.codesmithtools.com/) to talk about their [PLINQO templates](http://www.codeplex.com/codesmith) that enhance Microsoft's LINQ to SQL. These templates are an add-on to CodeSmith, which is a great code generation tool.

Please check out the article.
