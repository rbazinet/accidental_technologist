[![banner-scalingrails](http://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/MyInterviewwithGreggPollackonInfoQ_CCB2/banner-scalingrails_thumb.png "banner-scalingrails")](http://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/MyInterviewwithGreggPollackonInfoQ_CCB2/banner-scalingrails_2.png) I had the opportunity to [chat with Gregg Pollack](http://www.infoq.com/articles/gregg-pollack-scaling-rails) about his recent venture into [screencasting about scaling Ruby on Rails](http://railslab.newrelic.com/scaling-rails). It was an interesting interview and I hope it gives those folks not sure about Ruby on Rails, because they have heard it can?t scale, a chance to look at it again. It certainly can but like any other platform it needs to be done right.

Thanks [Gregg](http://greggsoup.com/).
