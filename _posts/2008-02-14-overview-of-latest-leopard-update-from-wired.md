Apple released Leopard update 10.5.2 a couple days ago which is intended to fix many of the common complaints with the operating system. I ran the update as soon as I had heard it was available and it installed without problem. I did hear a few people having problems but they seemed like isolated incidents and I am not aware of the details.

Wired Blog Network had an article titled [Latest Leopard Update Resolves Common Complaints](https://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2008/02/latest-leopard.html) which highlights some of the major updates and biggest complaints. I was going to write up something about the updates but since Scott Gilbertson already beat me too it, I figured I would just quote some of the details he gives.

When I ran the update on my MacBook Pro it weighed in a whopping 370MB, bigger than I expected. The shear size alone should be a good indication at the number of fixes. The [release notes on this update from Apple](https://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=307109) are worth looking at for details on particular fixes, but the important ones from Wired:

> - AirPort - improves connection reliability and stability
> - Mail - numerous bug fixes and better handling of SMTP servers
> - RAW image support for several new cameras (Canon, Nikon [and more](https://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306835))
> - Safari - patches a security flaw that affected only Leopard?s version of Safari 3
> - Third Party Apps - Improves general stability when running third-party applications.

Below are some additional links to some other sources of information on the update.

I think this update is big in working toward fixing some of the items people complained about. I have not had any real issues with Leopard since I installed it but my use is not 100% of my daily computing time.
