Someone please tell me why [this news](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspx) from Microsoft really matter? I can get all I need by using Reflector to view the code today. I can then use and modify what Reflector gives me. Once Microsoft releases the source and I agree to use it like a good person I can not use it in my projects.

I have seen so many people standing on rooftops in blogs patting Microsoft on the back for this news. Why? It's not like they are releasing this as open source. You can't contribute to it. So who cares!

Look at some of the reaction :

> [Fallen Rouge says](http://www.fallenrogue.com/articles/227-Microsoft-net-framework-source-code-libraries) "Wow. wow. Wow".

> [Ayende Rahien says](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AyendeRahien/~3/164789162/The-CLR-Sources.aspx) "...this is huge"

> [Sam Gentile says](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SamGentile/~3/165208244/bcl-net-framework-library-source-code-publically-available.aspx) "This is great news!"

Ted Neward has a [nice and inciteful reaction](http://blogs.tedneward.com/2007/10/03/Reports+Of+Snowballs+In+Hell.aspx) to the news which I think is more in line with reality and taking and putting the news in context with what it really means.

Would someone please explain why this is important and why I should care? At this point it is news consisting of only fluff..no stuff.
