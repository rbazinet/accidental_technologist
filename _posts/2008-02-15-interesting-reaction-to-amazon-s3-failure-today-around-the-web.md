I [blogged about my thoughts on the Amazon S3](http://rbazinet.wordpress.com/2008/02/15/thoughts-on-amazon-s3-outage-and-cloud-computing/) failure today and what it meant to me and cloud computing in general. There was a fair amount of reaction and feedback out on the web and I wanted to share the comments I enjoyed most.

It is interesting how fast the blogs pick up on a failure by someone like Amazon, almost like vultures. I guess most people look for a ding in the armor of companies with spotless records.

I like the reaction from SmugMug who was not effected by the outage. I write for [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/), who recently switched over to Amazon S3 and EC2 for their video distribution and we were not effected at all. The configuration we have was implemented in such a way that caching saved us.
