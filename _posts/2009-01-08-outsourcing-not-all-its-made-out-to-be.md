This is some of the best news I have seen in a very long time, from [Obie Fernandez?s blog](http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/2009/01/satyam-schadenfreude.html):

> You may have heard that Satyam, one of the most prominent Indian IT outsourcing firms, is in [deep doo-doo](http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/jan2009/gb2009017_807784.htm) this week, due to revelations that they inflated their balance sheet by almost a $1 billion (among other sins).

One of the things that annoys me as an American software developer trying to make a living with my craft are those companies who outsource software development to India and other countries like Russia. I have nothing against these countries or anyone I know from them but I have been involved in too many projects which outsourced some of their development to India and seeing first-hand the quality of code coming back..well, let?s just say the term ?junk? comes to my mind.

I don?t know if the disconnect is with people in our country trying to give half-baked requirements to overseas partners but it does not work very well. Obie?s experience has been similar:

> Over the years, some of my bigger enterprise clients have flushed ridiculous amounts of money down the toilet with Satyam, Wipro and Infosys. All of us collaborating and integrating with their software teams were privy to their dirty, little secret. They usually had one guy that actually knew (anything about) programming, floating at least five or six others that didn't have a clue and hid behind the excuse of language barriers. However, since their individual bill rates where around $20 or less, the managers on this side of the world thought they were getting a great deal!

This pleases me very much indeed. So, anyone in larger companies outsourcing, take a note here and bring development back in-house, in America where it belongs.
