![Podcast RSS](/assets/img/2013/02/Podcast-RSS.jpg "Podcast-RSS.jpg") I subscribe and listen to a lot of podcasts. ?I wrote about some of my favorites before,?[7 Great iOS and Mac Developer Podcasts to Learn from Today](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/objective-c-2/7-great-ios-and-mac-developer-podcasts-to-learn-from-today/), and I wanted to share some more today. ## CMD+Space

 Hosted by [Myke Hurley](http://www.70decibels.com/hosts/myke-hurley.html), [CMD+Space](http://www.70decibels.com/cmdspace)?is a show with interviews various independent Mac and iOS developers from the perspective of running their businesses and how they got to where they are today. So many developers go independent all the time and could use some solid guidance. CMD+Space is on then [70decibels network](http://www.70decibels.com/shows/) which hosts many other shows that you might find interesting. ## Debug

 Hosts Guy English and Rene Ritchie have been running this podcast for the past few weeks but it quickly became one to get sync'd to my iPhone for listening while driving or daily walks. [Debug](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/debug/id578812394) is also an interview show with well-known Mac and iOS developers. ?As often happens while I listen to interviews various questions come to mind that go unanswered, not the case here. ?These guys seem to ask the questions I want answered. ?Coincidence? ?Most likely but the great questions result in solid advice. ## Identical Cousins

 Hosted by Michael and Brent Simmons, they discuss various topics important to Mac and iOS developers who are mainly independent but also those gainfully employed at companies large and small. I stumbled across [Identical Cousins](http://identicalcousins.net) while listening to another podcast, which is often the case. ## Iterate

 This podcast is a bit different with a focus on the design side of mobile development for Mac, iOS and Android applications. [Iterate](http://bjango.com/articles/iterate/) is hosted by Rene Ritchie and others. ?Rene seems to be a repeat name here and other podcasts including MacBreak Weekly.
