I came across a couple videos from the JAOO 2007 Conference. I was not able to attend but much content has been made available.

The interview with the creator of [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org), [Joe Armstrong](https://armstrongonsoftware.blogspot.com/) is two parts and is over on Channel 9.

- [JAOO 2007: Joe Armstrong - On Erlang, OO, Concurrency, Shared State and the Future, Part 1](https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=351659)
- [JAOO 2007: Joe Armstrong - On Erlang, OO, Concurrency, Shared State and the Future, Part 2](https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=352343)

Joe is also the author of the new book from Pragmatic Bookshelf, [Programming Erlang: Software for a Concurrent World](https://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang/).

The videos are great looks at [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org) and concurrency issues in general. I have started working with [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/) and found the videos to be very good.
