When taking the plunge into Ruby on Rails it’s really easy to get carried away with learning all about the framework. It’s easy to learn the fundamentals and later realize the Rails community is a community of testers. It’s a strange world when you set out to learn about testing, TDD (test-driven development), BDD (behavior-driven development) and other acronyms and phrases relating to testing Ruby on Rails applications. I decided to put together a short list of helpful resources to get started. If you have suggestions that would be useful to be added to this list, please add a comment or email me directly and I’ll update this post.

## Books

- [Everyday Rails Testing with RSpec](https://leanpub.com/everydayrailsrspec) - this is a great, hands-on, roll-up your sleeves and get-to-work book. If you want to use RSpec on a daily basis, this book gives great advice on how to use RSpec in your day-to-day routine. It’s kept up-to-date with latest RSpec too.
- [Rails 5 Test Prescriptions](https://pragprog.com/book/nrtest3/rails-5-test-prescriptions) - I use this book as a reference I often go to. It’s been updated to from previous versions to now Rails 5 and is a great tool to have on the shelf.
- [Effective Testing with RSpec 3](https://pragprog.com/book/rspec3/effective-testing-with-rspec-3) - if you decide you’d rather start without worrying about all the details around Rails you can start with learning RSpec with plain Ruby and help yourself. I’ve been through this one cover-to-cover and it’s a great tutorial.
- [The Minitest Cookbook](https://chriskottom.com/minitestcookbook/) - if you decide RSpec isn’t for you, this is probably the ultimate resource for Minitest. Well-written and kept up-to-date.
 
## Podcasts

 You can’t really learn testing from a podcast but you can learn how others approach the craft. The first is a podcast dedicated to testing Ruby applications. The rest is a list of a few episodes of podcasts that discussed testing. - [The Ruby Testing Podcast](https://www.rubytestingpodcast.com/)
- [Ruby Rogues 385: “Ruby/Rails Testing” with Jason Swett](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/rr-385-ruby-rails-testing-with-jason-swett/)
- [Ruby Rogues 269 Testing](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/269-rr-testing/)
- [Full Stack Radio 46: Joe Ferris - Test Driven Rails](https://www.fullstackradio.com/46)
 
 I’ve been listening to The Ruby Testing Podcast and picked up some nice tidbits so far. ## Training

 I love [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/). - [RSpec the Right Way](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/rspec-the-right-way)
- [Test-driven Rails with RSpec, Capybara, and Cucumber](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/test-driven-rails-rspec-capybara-cucumber)
 
 Xavier Shay has long been involved in the Ruby community and well-known for discussions around testing. One of his best blog posts [explains his approach to testing](https://rhnh.net/2012/12/20/how-i-test-rails-applications/). - [Testing Ruby Applications with RSpec](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/rspec-ruby-application-testing)
 
 I’ve taken several courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and they are one of my favorite places for training. The prices are low and there are many courses, so you have to do a bit of work to see which course is right for you but well worth the effort. - [The Complete TDD Course: Master Ruby Development with RSpec](https://www.udemy.com/complete-tdd-course-ruby-rspec/)
- [Ruby on Rails 5 - BDD, RSpec and Capybara](https://www.udemy.com/ruby-rails-5-bdd-rspec-capybara/)
