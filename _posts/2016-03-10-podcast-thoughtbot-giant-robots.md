I have an addiction to podcasts. There, I said it. According to my podcast player, I am subscribed to 38 podcasts. Definitely too many to keep up with very easily. I am constantly rotating new ones in and old ones out but always keeping my favorites queued up. One of my favorites of late is [The Giant Robots Smashing into Other Giant Robots](http://giantrobots.fm/) from Thoughtbot. It's not a new podcast but recently has taken on a new format, where the topics focus more on building and running Saas products within Thoughtbot. Recent episodes chronicle [Upcase](https://upcase.com/join) and [FormKeep](https://formkeep.com/). Topics include:

- Pricing
- Customer acquisition and retention
- Churn
- B2B vs B2C
- Choosing Features
- Etc.
 
 The format of the show reminds me a bit of agile weekly stand-ups. The hosts take turns discussing goals for the week, how they made their products better for users, what could be better. Lots to learn and take away from this one. Well worth subscribing if you're building and launching your own products.
