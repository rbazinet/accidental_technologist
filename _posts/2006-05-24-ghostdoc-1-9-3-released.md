Roland Weigelt released an [updated version](https://weblogs.asp.net/rweigelt/archive/2006/05/24/GhostDoc-1.9.3-_2800_for-Visual-Studio-2005_2900_-Released.aspx) of his product called GhostDoc. If you haven't used this product it is a Visual Studio 2005 add-in which makes quick work of a meanial task in VS, documenting method headers. I have been using GhostDoc since the VS 2003 release (1.3) and have been happy with the simple ability to take care of an important task for me. Check it out, it's well worth the effort.
