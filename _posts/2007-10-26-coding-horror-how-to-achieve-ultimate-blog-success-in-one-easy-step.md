I am a regular reader of Jeff Atwood's blog and always get something useful out of his posts, I find them well thought out and worth the read.

Jeff had a great post today called [How To Achieve Ultimate Blog Success In One Easy Step](https://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000983.html?r=28993#endcomments). Jeff gives great advice:

> When people ask me for advice on blogging, I always respond with yet another form of the same advice: **pick a schedule you can live with, and *stick to it*. Until you do that, none of the other advice I could give you will matter.** I don't care if you [suck at writing](https://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000516.html). I don't care if [nobody reads your blog](https://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000536.html). I don't care if you have [nothing interesting to say](https://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000297.html). If you can demonstrate a willingness to write, and a desire to keep continually improving your writing, you will eventually be successful.

I have been blogging for a couple years now but I have not committed to a regular schedule. My usual reasons are I am too busy with clients, family or life in general. As Jeff points out, a blog should be part of your regular life and commit to a schedule you can stick with and post something.

I am committing here to post 3 times a week and see if I can make my blog more popular and my writing better.
