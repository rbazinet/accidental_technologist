![Update your blog](/assets/img/2012/08/update-your-blog.gif "update-your-blog.gif")

[Scott Hanselman had a great piece](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx) of the weekend about controlling your content destiny by blogging more and "tweeting" less. ? I use "tweeting" as the generic term for putting content on social networks like Twitter, Facebook and Google+.

In the past year or so I admit to blogging less and "tweeting" more. ?I spend a fair amount of time on Twitter and an increasing amount on Google+, but the truth is, Scott is right and those places don't care about me at all.?

> **You are not blogging enough.?**<span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px; text-align: left;">You are pouring your words into increasingly closed and often walled gardens. You are giving control - and sometimes ownership - of your content to social media companies that will SURELY fail.

I think the reason blogging is in decline is because sharing a thought is so much easier on Twitter. ?In 140 characters you can get a thought out and be done. ?Blogging is a craft which takes some to evolve the thought into something someone else might want to read.?

Twitter cares only about Twitter which is shown by their [recent announcement of upcoming API changes](https://dev.twitter.com/blog/changes-coming-to-twitter-api) which mainly stick it to developers. ?Pay-for social networks like App.net are popping up which claim to allow users to keep their content. ?I'm sorry, but no way I am forking out $50 for a Twitter clone. ?

Also remember, blog for yourself, not for the audience. ?Say what you want to say because it's your soapbox to do so. ?Blog on.
