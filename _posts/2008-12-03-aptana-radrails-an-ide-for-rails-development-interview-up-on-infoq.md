I had been working on an interview with Javier Ramirez, author of [Aptana RadRails, An IDE for Rails Development](https://www.packtpub.com/aptana-rapid-rails-development/book). It was a good interview as Javier really knows his [Aptana RadRails](https://www.aptana.com/rails/). It was eye-opening for me because I had not looked at the Aptana RadRails development environment in a long time and it has come a long way since becoming part of Aptana. It is worth checking out for sure.

The book itself is a good read and a good introduction to the IDE itself. If just starting out with RadRails this book would be a good companion around the IDE. My complaint when using RadRails before was exactly how to use it, this book helps. It also helps RadRails has come a long way since then.

The interview is pretty long and [can be read on the InfoQ web site](https://www.infoq.com/articles/javier-ramirez-interview).
