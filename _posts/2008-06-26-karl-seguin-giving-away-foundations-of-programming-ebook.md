[Karl Sequin](http://codebetter.com/blogs/karlseguin/archive/2008/06/24/foundations-of-programming-ebook.aspx) is giving away what appears to be a great fundamental of programming book called [Foundations of Programming](http://codebetter.com/files/folders/codebetter_downloads/entry179694.aspx).

Karl says:

> I'm excited to finally release the official, and completely free, Foundations of Programming E-book. This essentially contains all 9 Foundation parts including a conclusion and some typical book fluff (table of content, acknowledgement and so on). A number of spelling errors were corrected, along with some small technical changes and clarifications - largely based on feedback, so thanks for everyone who provided it! Otherwise it's exactly the same as what's been posted here over the past several months.

The book is 79 pages long in a nice PDF. I have not had the chance to go through it all but what I read looks really good. And did I mention, it's FREE?

As you can see the Table of Contents contains many of subjects discussed with fellow developers today including ALT.NET. The is really good and easy to read and comprehend.
