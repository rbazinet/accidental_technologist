I picked up this [post](https://codebetter.com/blogs/jeffrey.palermo/archive/2005/10/11/132969.aspx) from Jeffrey Palermo, it appears the Visual Studio 2005 RTM will be available to MSDN Universal subscribers. I haven't seen an official Microsoft announcement yet but it's still something to keep a watch out for.
