I wrote up a [list of alternative Ruby web frameworks some time ago](http://accidentaltechnologist.com/ruby/10-alternative-ruby-web-frameworks/) and now [Engine Yard has published a new list](https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/life-beyond-rails-brief-look-alternate-web-frameworks-ruby). Some of my original picks are in there, so it's great to see they've continued. A couple notables include [Volt](http://voltframework.com/), for running Ruby on the server as-well-as the client, and [Cramp](http://cramp.in/) that helps with needing a lot of open connections and bi-directional communication. A great list to check out.
