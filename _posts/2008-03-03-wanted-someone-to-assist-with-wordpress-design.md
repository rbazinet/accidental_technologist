I have been running this blog for quite sometime now and would like to hire someone to make some design changes to it.

My blog is currently hosted by Wordpress and I am not interested in changing this, I have built a good traffic base with the basic domain from Wordpress and also don't want to deal with self-hosting.

With that said, I am not impressed by the current built-in designs at the free Wordpress hosted service. I would pay to have my own theme but the best Wordpress offer right now is the ability to customize a built-in theme with CSS changes. I think this is all I need but I am not a designer and not very fluent in CSS work.

So, I am looking for a designer who has taken the built-in Wordpress theme and made changes to them for people. I want the design taken care of as well as the CSS to go along with it.

Please reach me at rbazinet at gmail dot com.

If Wordpress is listening, I would pay a reasonable annual fee to have my own theme hosted on Wordpress.
