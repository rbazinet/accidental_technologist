I have been working for the past few weeks on an interview with [John Lam](https://www.iunknown.com/), Program Manager on the Dynamic Language Runtime Team and the leader of the [IronRuby project](https://www.ironruby.net/). The interview is complete is is [now up on InfoQ for all to read](https://www.infoq.com/articles/state-of-ironruby).

I think the interview gives some good insight to where the team is today with the implementation and where they need to be once they release IronRuby 1.0. John was gracious in responding to my questions, even though he is extremely busy with this project.

It is an exciting time for Ruby developers whether you are on Linux, Mac or Windows and whether your company is committed to running applications on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or you are a Microsoft shop committed to .NET. Very soon you will be able to take a Ruby application and run it anywhere.

There are some announcements coming from MIX08 in March from Microsoft we will not want to miss which will shed some more light on where IronRuby is in relation to the DLR and Silverlight.

I have some announcements coming of my own which I consider exciting as well but a bit too early to talk about.
