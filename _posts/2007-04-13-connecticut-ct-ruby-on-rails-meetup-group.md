I recently discovered the [CT Ruby on Rails Meetup Group](http://ruby.meetup.com/92/) while searching for?a local Ruby and Ruby on Rails group.? I had discovered the [MetroWest Ruby Meetup Group](http://ruby.meetup.com/87/) a while back but never can seem to get the time to get to a meeting. I have not gone to a CT Ruby on Rails Meetup yet but I plan to on the next meeting, May 10.? I will report back how the meeting goes.? I spoke to one of the members and the first couple meet ups have been laid back with folks meeting at Panera Bread in Manchester, CT.? I think there is a need to have a location for demos and speakers, but we will see. The founder of the group is?Theron Parlin?who is involved with [HappyCodr](http://www.happycodr.com/), a Ruby on Rails application showcase site and [Geezeo](http://geezeo.com/), a personal finance site also developed in Rails.? So it looks like the group is for real.
