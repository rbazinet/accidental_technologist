I recently joined [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/), a very good resource for .NET, Java, Ruby and Agile developers. It's doesn't cost anything to join so you have nothing to lose. Setting up your profile allows you to choose the language or platform you want to see information on, Ruby and Ruby on Rails and .NET in my case.

The site has a wealth of information from so many difference sources. I find many sites that are a mish-mash of user-entered news is more junk than not. I find [Digg](http://www.digg.com) to be a good example of this, but not InfoQ, in my opinion.

##### Ruby related goodies :

- [Mr. Neighborly's Humble Little Ruby Book](http://www.infoq.com/minibooks/ruby) - a nice reference for the Ruby language. This is a free book if you want it in PDF format or $9.95 if you want the print version.
- [The Beauty of Ruby video](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/beauty-of-ruby-vanderburg) - an hour long talk about Ruby from the JAOO Conference. This is an introduction to the language.

This is just an example from a Ruby perspective. There are so many good articles and video presentations, InfoQ is worth it to check out.
