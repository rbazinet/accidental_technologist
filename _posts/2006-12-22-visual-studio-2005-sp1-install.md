I know it has been a while since I have posted here but I have been very busy with a slight change in my work.? I have left my architect position at [All Star Incentive Marketing](http://www.incentiveusa.com) and decided to go out and give consulting a try again.? I had done consulting for a while until the dotcom bust and took a permanent employee position. I have been working on a large contract with Pfizer and some other smaller ones since my last post.? I plan to start blogging again on a more regular basis after the first of the year. Anyway, the point of my post is the release of [Service Pack 1 for Visual Studio 2005](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=BB4A75AB-E2D4-4C96-B39D-37BAF6B5B1DC&displaylang=en).? Unless you have been living under a rock you have heard of the release from Microsoft a short time ago.?? I have been waiting for this release for a while now with the hopes of fixing some of the annoying performance problems and other bugs hanging around.? The download is a whopping 431mb, which is a BIG service pack. **Installation** Installing the service pack went very well with a few things you need to be aware of prior to installing, such as:

- Uninstalling Web Application Projects, if installed.? The service pack will install a new version of this application.
- A large amount of disk space is needed, upwards of around 2G free.
- A large amount of time - the service pack takes more time to install than the original Visual Studio install.? The service pack will install once for each flavor of Visual Studio 2005 you have installed.
 
 All-in-all the installation went very well but did take a long time.? I suggest doing it at the end of the day or some other downtime. [Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/12/15/visual-studio-2005-service-pack-1-sp1-released.aspx) has some pieces of advice on his web site about the installation which is worth checking out.
