![crazyman.jpg](https://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/crazyman.jpg)My current laptop I use most of the day either in my home office or on the road is a Dell Latitude D820. I have had it about a year and half with the exception of the last month or so I have been very happy with it.

The last month the fan has been getting louder and louder to the point I almost bought a new Lenovo Thinkpad T61 but it sounded a bit irrational, clear evidence of how crazy it has been making me. The fan is running at maximum speed most of time and almost screaming. I was at one of my clients this week and people even commented how loud it was and asking if that annoying sound was my laptop. Embarrassingly enough, I had to admit that it certain was my laptop.

I started searching the Internet a bit and found others who had the same problem in both the same and different Latitude models. I also decided to check out the [Dell Support Site](https://support.dell.com) to see if any problems like this had been reported. It turns out there is a new BIOS version, A07, which addressed the problem because the quiet mode of the laptop could not be set correctly. Unfortunately, I already had version A07 of the BIOS installed.

There were a few forum posts I came across that shed some light on the solution; cleaning the fan. It had never dawned on me that this would be a problem. One bit of information was on [Devshed](https://forums.devshed.com/computer-hardware-103/laptop-cpu-fan-gets-really-loud-447931.html) and made me think a bit about how and where I use my laptop.

My work environment is either the home office or a client and it's never dusty. I figured it was worth a shot to clean the fan. I grabbed my trusty can of compressed air and, while the system was still running, blew the air into as many different angles as I could. I was surprised to see the amount of dust coming out of the fan.

Once I was done the fan took about 2 minutes to slow down and become extremely quiet. I would never have guessed the solution would be so simple. One gentleman [takes his D600 apart once every 6 months and cleans the fan and heat sink](https://geekswithblogs.net/lorint/archive/2006/06/12/81623.aspx).

I think I will have to start making this as part of my system maintenance routine to keep my fan quiet and my clients happy.
