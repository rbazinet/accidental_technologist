I manage a small team of developers on what seems to be a never-ending project. The project seems never end because of the shear size of it and the number of developers dedicated to it. We do not have a dedication Project Manager who does nothing but manage all day. I am the closest one to being a Project Manager. I have kept my sanity using a piece of software from [Safari Software](http://www.safarisoftware.com/) called [MasterList Professional](http://www.safarisoftware.com/mlp.htm). Master List Professional is not a full-blown project management solution but more of a task list manager. I could be using Microsoft Project but I think I would rather stick a pin in my eye than have to use that useless piece of software. Sure, people use it but when I have tried to use it in the past I spent more time managing MS Project than I did actually managing my role on the project. ![masterlist.jpg](http://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2006/05/masterlist.jpg) MasterList has proved to be invaluable. The software fits my style like a glove, letting me:

- Create Projects
- Create Task Lists
- Create Appointments/Meetings
- Create Check Lists
 
 All while letting me set priorities on everything. It makes getting organized very easy and easy stay that way. I have had problems in the past with not getting organized with software but staying that way. I am NOT affiliated with Safari Software but thought there maybe some developers out there trying to keep things straight and having a hard time of it.
