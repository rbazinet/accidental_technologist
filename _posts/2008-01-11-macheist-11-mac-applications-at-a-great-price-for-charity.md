In the event you are a Mac user and [didn't know about MacHeist](http://www.macheist.com/), here it is:

> #### The MacHeist bundle is back!
> 
> Last year's bundle caused a frenzy in the Mac community, selling over 16,000 copies in a week. This year, we're setting our sights a little higher, with a larger bundle, a two week sale, and what we believe to be a stronger collection of apps. Simply put, this is the best Mac software deal in history.
> 
> ##### Explore the bundle
> 
> The great part about indie Mac software is a "try before you buy" mentality. All applications in the bundle can be given a test run before you buy.
> 
> ##### Feeling charitable?
> 
> Last year, our members were offered a choice of charities to have 25% of their purchase donated to. This initiative became a spectacular success, with $200,000 raised by the end of the event. This year, we're hoping to shatter last year's record numbers, and show how generous the Mac community can be.
> 
> ##### Share with your friends
> 
> Much of MacHeist's success has been thanks to a tremendous amount of word of mouth spread. To encourage MacHeist members to bring friends into the fold, we'll be offering additional free applications to those who manage to spread the bundle. More information about this program will be coming soon.

There are 11 applications totalling $368.75 for only $49. Did I mention it goes to charity? Applications include:

- 1password
- CoverSutra
- Cha-Ching
- iStopMotion
- Awaken
- Speed Download
- AppZapper
- TaskPaper
- CSSEdit
- Snapz Pro X
- Pixelmator

CSSEdit, Snapz Pro X and Pixelmator unlock once there is a pre-determined level of buyers for the bundle, but I am confident it will be reached.

Head over and [buy the bundle](https://www.macheist.com/) for charity.
