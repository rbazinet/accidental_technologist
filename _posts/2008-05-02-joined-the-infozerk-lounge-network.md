I don't believe in using my blog as a generator of revenue but as a way to share information in the community. [As of May 1 I have joined](http://infozerk.com/averyblog/may-lounge-update/) [The Lounge by InfoZerk](http://www.infozerk.com/thelounge/). I have been a long-time follower of James Avery, reading [his blog](http://infozerk.com/averyblog/) and seeing him on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/averyj). We were introduced when I started using [GraffitiCMS](http://graffiticms.com/) as my blogging engine and his [Graffiti.Redirect plugin](http://code.google.com/p/graffiti-redirect/) ([which I am now a contributor](http://infozerk.com/averyblog/graffiti-redirect-0-2/)).[![loungelogo](http://www.accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/JoinedtheInfozerkLounge_F33F/loungelogo_3.gif)](http://www.infozerk.com/thelounge/)

I decided to join The Lounge for several reasons:

- The network consists of many people I respect in the development community.
- The advertisers are top-notch organizations and am proud to have them represented on my blog.
- Self-promotion, getting the work out about the products and services I provide.
- The payment we receive being part of the network can go toward server hosting fees.

All in all, I think it is definitely a win-win for everyone. You can read the [announcement about the new Lounge members](http://infozerk.com/averyblog/may-lounge-update/) on the Infozerk blog.
