I'm thinking about productized consulting today. The latest episode of TropicalMBA, [The One Where a Business Starts on the Show](https://www.tropicalmba.com/productized/), lays out plans for creating a productized service and got my mind on what I'd like to do. It seems like a great business model. I need to think more about this.
