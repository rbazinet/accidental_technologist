I am leaving for my flight to Orlando tonight to attend the [sold out](https://rorblog.techcfl.com/2008/02/05/acts_as_conference-is-sold-out/) regional Ruby and Rails conference, [acts\_as\_conference](https://www.actsasconference.com/). [![badge_med_sponsor](https://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/badge-med-sponsor-thumb.png)](https://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/badge-med-sponsor.png)

The conference is the first time it has been put on and hopefully it will carry on in future years. The [lineup of speakers](https://www.actsasconference.com/speakers) looks great and it should be a good time. I [interviewed](https://www.infoq.com/news/2008/01/acts-as-conference/) the creator of the event, Robert Dempsey, back in the beginning of January to give InfoQ readers a feel for what the conference was about. I was excited about the content so I figured I would sign up.

I am anxious for the [Charity Session](https://www.changingthepresent.org/registries/show/1162) with Ezra Zygmuntowicz and Evan Phoenix from the [Rubinius Project](https://rubini.us/).

This will be the first conference of the year for me and I will blog a bit from the event. I am also planning on attending [RailsConf 2008](https://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/content/home) in May.
