[![iRecorderScreen](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPhoneApplicationiRecorder_8468/iRecorderScreen_thumb.png "iRecorderScreen")](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/iPhoneApplicationiRecorder_8468/iRecorderScreen_2.png) It always seems that when I have an idea, a to-do or something I would like to write down, I am in the car driving. Maybe this is my creative time where I am not writing software, working on an article or something else that needs my full attention. Sure, I should be paying attention when I am driving, I am, but my mind seems to come up with thoughts I need to make a note of and I can?t. Until now actually, with the introduction of [iRecorder for the iPhone by SimpleTouch Software](http://www.simpletouchsoftware.com/SimpleTouch/iRecorder.html).

This little utility has a nice, simple user interface with allows me to just press **Record** button, say what I have to say and then press **Stop**.

I was introduced to this utility from [Bob Walsh over at the 47hats blog](http://www.47hats.com/?p=1101). He started using this tool as well with similar.

</div>I have just started working with iRecorder but so far it is awesome. I really like the ability to sync with my laptop over WIFI, which allows me to get my recordings saved and edited as I want.
