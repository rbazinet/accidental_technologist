A new magazine has hit the Ruby world, giving us our first Ruby-only publication, called [The Rubyist](http://magcloud.com/browse/Magazine/2284). It is Published by [Jeremy McAnally](http://www.jeremymcanally.com/), author of the [Humble Little Ruby Book](http://www.humblelittlerubybook.com/) and Ruby conference speaker.

The Rubyist is described as:

> A technical magazine focused on technical content and the happenings in the world of Ruby, Rails, Merb, and anything else related to our favorite programming language.
