![SimpleMailr med](/assets/img/2013/12/SimpleMailr-med.png "SimpleMailr-med.png")

I?ve been working on a SaaS application for the past number of months named [SimpleMailr](http://simplemailr.com/). It has gone through several iterations as I try to convey my intentions for the service. ?In a one-liner, SimpleMailr is intended to ?Get your newsletter in the hands of your readers easier.?

I?ve tried and used several services such as MailChimp, Constant Contact, Campaign Monitor and others but there is a certain amount of barrier to entry. ?I want something simple to setup, simple to get that first newsletter to readers and simple to do over and over. ?The end goal is getting content to readers and make it easy.

Using SimpleMailr you will be able to:

1\. Easily add an existing list of email addresses. ?If you know how to type an email address, copy and paste a list of address or upload an Excel file with email address in it, you will be able to get your list into SimpleMailr. ?If you don?t feel comfortable with any means available..simply contact <hello@simplemailr.com> and we will do it for you.?

2\. Easily add newsletter content to get your first issue out the door. ?The content of your newsletter is the heart of what you have to share, even if you are familiar with HTML you can add your text and not worry about the details.

3\. Send it. ?There?s really nothing more involved once you have something to say. ?Once your ready, just press the send button and we will do the rest.

4\. If you care about stats, stats you will have. ?Know how many subscribers you have, how many were sent your content, how many received it and bounce details. ?If you want it, we will have it.

I would really like to get feedback on how you use newsletter marketing today as well as how you would like to use it in the future. ?What could be better? ?What?s missing with your current solution? ?Tell me about your ideal solution. ?Feel free to send an email to <hello@simplemailr.com> and start the conversation. ?No obligation and I promise not to send any sales pitches your way. ?You will be helping me build the best and most useful solution I can.
