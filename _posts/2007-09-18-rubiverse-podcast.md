I recently discovered a Ruby-focused podcast called [Rubiverse Podcast](https://rubiverse.com/). It is a new podcast, so the number of episodes are limited but the first two are very good.

The [most recent one is an interview](https://rubiverse.com/podcasts/2-scott-bellware-on-microsoft-and-ruby) with [Scott Bellware](https://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/) who is a Microsoft MVP but sees the downsides of Microsoft and has been gravitating toward Ruby on Rails. I really enjoyed the interview.

Scott's viewpoint is much as mine is these days and its nice to hear Scott speak the way I feel. Scott is the found of the [ALT.NET Conference](https://altnetconf.com/) and one I wish I could attend. I am glad I am not the only one out there who thinks there has to be a better way to make a living.
