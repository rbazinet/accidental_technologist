I will be heading up to Toronto for the [RubyFringe](https://rubyfringe.com/) event at the [Metropolitan](https://www.metropolitan.com/toronto/), July 18-20. I will be at the event representing [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com) and doing some interviews of some of the speakers. If any speaker sees this and is interested in being interviewed please contact me at rbazinet at gmail.com. We can talk about interview topics so I can get a set of questions done beforehand. InfoQ has determined interviews will be done on Sunday as the interview room and camera person will be available.

The RubyFringe organizers describe the event as:

> RubyFringe is an avant-garde conference for developers that are excited about emerging Ruby projects and technologies. We're mounting a unique and eccentric gathering of the people and projects that are driving things forward in our community.
