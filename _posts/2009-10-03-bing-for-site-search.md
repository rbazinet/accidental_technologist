I have been using Microsoft Bing as my main search provider from both Internet Explorer and Firefox for a while now and I have to say it has been working really well. I was a bit skeptical at first, mainly because Microsoft search has lagged behind Google for so long.

I decided to change my blog search to Bing tonight. I like the way it allows for local searching of a topic but then allows to see results from the web too. I have done many test searches on this site and it is working great.

Anyone can do the same for a web site for which they can edit HTML and/or JavaScript. Check out - [http://www.bing.com/siteowner](http://www.bing.com/siteowner "http://www.bing.com/siteowner") to add Bing to a site.

If anyone gets results they didn?t expect or any odd behavior, please let me know.
