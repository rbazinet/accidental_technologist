I found this article, [Escape *Metropolis*: Bridging the Divide Between Developers and Architects](http://www.devx.com/enterprise/Article/32036) an interesting read.? I am both an architect and a developer and understand the distrust a developer has for an architect.? Since developers are the ones who produce the actual code they feel they are the real workers.? I strongly believe an Systems Architect really needs to be an active developer to do a good job and fully understand the problem at hand.? I know I have been in the role of architect and only because I was also a developer could I fully prove what I proposed was the right way to go.? It has happened where the proposed solution ended up being the wrong one and the reason it wasn't a problem was because it was found in the "proof of concept" phase, which is always needed. I have posted about this in the past [here](http://rbazinet.wordpress.com/2006/04/27/architects-who-don%e2%80%99t-write-code-are-%e2%80%9cpowerpoint-architects%e2%80%9d/).
