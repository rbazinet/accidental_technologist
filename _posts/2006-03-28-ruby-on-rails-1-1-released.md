[Ruby on Rails 1.1 has been released](http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/articles/2006/03/28/rails-1-1-rjs-active-record-respond_to-integration-tests-and-500-other-things). This is a much anticipated release that touts many new features and a ton of bug fixes, 500+ I hear. Some of the major updates include:

- Ajax is easier with RJS, JavaScript in Ruby
- ActiveRecord – many new features including join models
- Third testing layer – integration, which allows for simulation of multiple concurrent users

Scott Raymond has a complete and thorough list [here](http://scottraymond.net/articles/2006/02/28/rails-1.1) of 1.1 new features.

I ran and update this morning to my Rails installation using <font face="Courier New">gem update rails</font> and tested the small apps I have running and all worked great. I am sure for more complex applications that you want a real deployment plan.
