Microsoft's Professional Developer's Conference (PDC) is being held September 13-16 2005 in Los Angeles, CA. It looks like a great time and one you don't to miss with sure discussions on VS 2005, Avalon, Indigo and Longhorn.

Channel 9 is talking a lot about this event and even has a contest for a free trip to PDC for the best blog post begging to go. Check it out.
