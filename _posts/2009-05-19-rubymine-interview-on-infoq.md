I have to admit I have tried using various IDE?s to build Ruby on Rails applications, Aptana RadRails and NetBeans are two, yet have come back to TextMate each time. I can?t say any of what I have tried were particularly bad, actually they were pretty good, but seemed a bit hefty for the work at hand. Recently, [JetBrains released RubyMine 1.0](https://blogs.jetbrains.com/ruby/2009/04/meet-jetbrains-rubymine-10-â€”-a-brand-new-ide-for-ruby-and-rails/) as their entry into Ruby IDE?s. I started using it for a couple of Rails projects I have been working on and I have to say, I am impressed with it so far. I plan to write up a further review or result of my work later here and on InfoQ but I need to work with it a bit more.

In the meantime, I had the opportunity to speak with the lead developer of [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/), Dmitry Jemerov, about RubyMine and the direction they are taking. It seems they are listening intently to their users. I can say this because as a RubyMine beta tester I had issues and they were promptly addressed.

The future looks bright for this product and I intend to keep using it to give it a fair test. Please take a few minutes to read my interview on InfoQ titled [Talking RubyMine with JetBrains Developer Dmitry Jemerov](https://www.infoq.com/articles/rubymine-dmitry-jemerov).
