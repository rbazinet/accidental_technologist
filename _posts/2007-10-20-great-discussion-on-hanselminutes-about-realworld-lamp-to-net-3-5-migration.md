I am a regular listener of [Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx) and usually make it part of a daily walk I do around the lakes we live on or on my commute to a client site. Those of you not familiar with [Scott Hanselman's](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) podcast about all different aspects of technology, it is worth a listen.

The most recent [podcast is with Matt Davis, architect at EarthClassMail.com](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=103) about their migration from using a LAMP (Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP) stack to Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2 and the .NET Framework 3.5.

Scott's podcasts normally run about 1/2 hour which is enough time to get an idea out and discussed but not so long it takes a bunch out of someone's busy schedule.

This podcast is a great listen from anyone contemplating going to .NET 3.5 and those features like LINQ, WCF, WPF and Atlas which we may end up using. Scott asks some great questions and Matt has some great answers. I am not familiar with Matt but he seems like a really bright guy with more than book-smart experience. EarthClassMail.com is large and complex application with many facets of its business.

Being an Architect myself I could relate to what Matt was faced with and how he solved the problems. The bold move to .NET 3.5 while in beta is something you don't normally year about. I think I may listen to this one again and I would like to hear future interviews with Matt or ones like this.
