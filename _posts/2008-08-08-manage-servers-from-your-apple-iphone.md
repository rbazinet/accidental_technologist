I have been using my iPhone version 1 for a while now and when Apple released version 2.0 of the iPhone firmware along with the app store I was really excited [![pTerm](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SSHfromyouAppleiPhone_148D8/pTerm_thumb.jpg)](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/SSHfromyouAppleiPhone_148D8/pTerm_2.jpg)to see some of the applications I could use. So far I use tools such as [Twitterrific](https://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific) and others but really only for minimal use, until today when [Instant Cocoa](https://www.instantcocoa.com/products/pTerm/) released [pTerm](https://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=287269552&mt=8) which allows SSH, Telnet and TCP connections from my iPhone. pTerm costs only $4.99 and will let me check my servers, change configuration or other maintenance from the road.

Features include:

- SSH, Telnet, and Raw Socket (TCP) support
- xterm terminal emulation
- 80x24 standard unix terminal window
- Pinch to zoom in the terminal
- Landscape and Portrait modes
- Support for CTRL keys
- Works over Edge, 3G, or WiFi connections
- Entirely based on [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/); if the features are in PuTTY, we can proably provide them on the iPhone!

[theAppleBlog lists additional details](https://theappleblog.com/2008/08/08/my-holy-grail-of-iphone-apps-arrives-pterm/) about the application. The web site lists the application as Version 1.0 with 1.1 ready and waiting for Apple. You can get this version from the [Apple Application Store](https://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=287269552&mt=8).
