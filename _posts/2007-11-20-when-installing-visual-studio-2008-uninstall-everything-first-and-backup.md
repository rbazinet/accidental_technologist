It's important to backup any changes to the settings you made to your development environment, such as fonts, colors, etc. This is done through the Tools menu and select Import/Export Settings.

It's also a good idea to backup your entire system. I don't see this kind of advice enough but I back up using [Acronis TrueImage](http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/) and get a good copy of my system out to my external USB drive, just in case either uninstalling does not work or the new install fails or maybe I uninstalled too much.

UPDATE: Rick Strahl has the RTM up and running, so [check out his post](http://west-wind.com/weblog/posts/192207.aspx) for details.
