[![GSkill2g](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TheDellMiniand2GRAM_A57C/GSkill2g_thumb.jpg "GSkill2g")](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/TheDellMiniand2GRAM_A57C/GSkill2g_2.jpg)It seems when ordering from Dell, the Dell Mini memory options are limited to 1G RAM. I understand this is due to some licensing issues with Windows XP and the Dell Mini easily supports 2G of RAM. I decided to check out my favorites computer parts supplier, NewEgg and found the [G.Skill 2G 200-Pin DDR2 PC4200 memory stick for $23.99, including shipping](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231146).

Installation was was pretty much a non-event;

- Remove the battery to remove all power from the system.
- Took out the two screws holding the cover to the underside of the Mini.
- Removed the existing memory stick.
- Install the new G.Skill memory stick.
- Replace the cover on the back of the Mini, reinstalling the (2) screws.
- Reinstall the battery.
- Boot up and verify in the BIOS, by pressing 2 on startup, that the new memory is recognized.

That?s all there is to it. When booting up into Ubuntu the new memory was recognized, nothing to configure there.
