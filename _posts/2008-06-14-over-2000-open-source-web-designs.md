I have an affliction that seems to prevent me from being able to create a web design I am happy with. I can easily point out what I consider a good design but creating is another story.

A web site, [pointed out by Mike Gunderloy over at the Web Worker Daily](https://webworkerdaily.com/2008/06/14/css-designs-for-free/), simple called [Open Source Web Designs](https://www.oswd.org/) is a great resource. The site has been around for the past 5 years and consists of designs submitted by the community. Most of the designs are XHTML and CSS, which I find particularly useful.

I have spent a bit of time going through the designs, particularly the ones [listed as the staff's favorites](https://www.oswd.org/designs/favorites/) and they look like truly unique designs. I have visited many sites in the past looking for web site templates and too many look just like a canned template. This site has some really nice designs.

Looking over the designs there a variety for company web sites as well as blog, definitely worth a look.
