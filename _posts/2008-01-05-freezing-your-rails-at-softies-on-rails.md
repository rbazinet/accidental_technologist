I ran across a really good tutorial over at [Softies on Rails](https://softiesonrails.com/) called "[Freezing Your Rails Application](https://softiesonrails.com/2008/1/3/freezing-your-rails-application)", which details what is means to freeze Rails, how-to do it and other great information:

- What Freezing Rails Is?
- Freeze to a particular Rails Version
- Freeze to Edge Rails
- Unfreezing
 
 It is great for new and old Rails developers as a reference to how-to manage the freeze process. <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" style="display:inline;margin:0;padding:0;">Technorati Tags: [Ruby](https://technorati.com/tags/Ruby),[Ruby on Rails](https://technorati.com/tags/Ruby%20on%20Rails)</div>
