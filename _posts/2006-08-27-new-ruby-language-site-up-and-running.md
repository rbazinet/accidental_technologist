[Ruby-lang.org is sporting a new look](http://new.ruby-lang.org/en/). If anyone has been a visitor to the old Ruby-lang.org site you will agree it needed an update, now it has it. They have done a good job and let's hope they keep it up-to-date now. This site has nice and easy navigation to a very good list of Ruby resources, documentation and of course downloading Ruby itself. Technorati Tags: [Ruby](http://technorati.com/tag/Ruby)
