In case you are one of the only people writing ASP.NET code who do not know who [Scott Guthrie](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/default.aspx) is, you should check out his site. Scott recently posted a list of what he felt was the best [ASP.NET 2.0 Tips and Tricks](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/pages/ASP.NET-2.0-Tips_2C00_-Tricks_2C00_-Recipes-and-Gotchas.aspx) from better than 200 posts he made over the past year.? Scott's posts are top-notch and I always learn something new.
