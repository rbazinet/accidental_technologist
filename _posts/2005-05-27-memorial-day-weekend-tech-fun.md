Well it's almost a holiday weekend for us in the U.S. I hope every enjoys the long weekend and remembers someone this weekend.

I plan on installing [Fedora Core 3](https://fedora.redhat.com) on an old Dell system this weekend, my first real attempt at a server running Linux. I expect to use this system as a web server, mail server and database server. The real experiment is how easy and feature-rich the [LAMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP) concept is with an eye toward and inexpensive cluster in the future. If all goes well I will also download and install [MONO](https://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page) at the same time. I am a C# developer by day and would like to explore C# on Linux, again as an avenue to cheaper server configurations.

I will report back how the install and configuration went and my overall thoughts on venturing into new territory.
