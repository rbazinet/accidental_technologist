This may be old news to most people out in the Microsoft Architecture world but it is news to me. Microsoft has a web site called [Skyscrapr](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/skyscrapr/default.aspx) and it is dedicated to the topic of Architecture.

It appears to be a portal to all things Architecture related on Microsoft web sites. I spent some time today going through the resources on the site and there is a wealth of information and links to many, many other resources.
