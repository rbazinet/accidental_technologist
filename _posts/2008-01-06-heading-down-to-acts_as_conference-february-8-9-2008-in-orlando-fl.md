I decided to start getting more involved in the Ruby and Ruby on Rails conferences this year and found a new conference to get it started, the [acts\_as\_conference](http://www.actsasconference.com/), February 8-9 in Orlando. I [blogged about this conference recently](http://rbazinet.wordpress.com/2008/01/02/acts_as_conference-looks-like-the-deal-of-the-year/) and had the [opportunity to interview](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/01/acts-as-conference) the conference organizer, [Robert Dempsey](http://rorblog.techcfl.com/), on [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com). I have flight book, room booked and the conference is paid for, so I am well on my way. I am hoping for good weather for the flight down. The lineup of speakers is top-notch and I can't wait to get down there and hear the latest from the Ruby and Ruby on Rails crowd. The speakers include:

- Evan Phoenix, Rubinus Project
- Obie Fernandez, author
- Ezra Zygmuntowicz, Merb creator and Engine Yard Founder
- Charles Nutter, JRuby creator
- Many others......
