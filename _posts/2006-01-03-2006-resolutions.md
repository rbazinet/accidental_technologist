Well, it's 2006 and I am back to work after a much needed vacation. The holidays were great and I was able to decompress and catch up on family time and think about some of the things I want to accomplish in 2006.

1. **Blog more** - I want to increase the frequency of my blog posts and improve the content.
2. **Learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails** - I would like to increase the number of programming languages I know and expand my exposure to those beyond Microsoft. I have done a fair amount of reading Ruby code and have been following the 37Signals development of Ruby on Rails.
3. **Get Products Out** - I have had several ideas on the back burner for some web-based products. I plan to get those out this year and it will be my foray into running a [microISV](http://www.technorati.com/tag/micro+isv).
4. **Go to a conference** - Attend at least one major conference this year, maybe TechED, maybe something else.
5. **Network** - I will get involved with 1-2 user groups or business groups and attend one meeting per month.

I am sure there are other things I would like to do but too long of a list will result in much less getting done.
