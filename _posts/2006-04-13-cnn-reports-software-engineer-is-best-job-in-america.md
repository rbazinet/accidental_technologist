OK, well the title says it all. [CNN has a story from Money.com](https://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bestjobs/) showing the results of a survey showing Software Engineers have the best jobs in America.

I don’t know how scientific this survey is but I think the stress level for most high-paying Software Engineering jobs is quite high. My vote for the best job would be for the #2 College Professor. Money reports the stress level is the same as the Software Engineer but I don’t see how. I know quite a few college professors and most seem laid back and not stressed. On the flip side I know many Software Engineers and they all seem a little too up-tight, myself included.
