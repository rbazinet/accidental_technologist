[![dsa](http://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/DataStructuresandAlgorithmseBookAvailabl_8896/dsa_3.png)](http://dotnetslackers.com/projects/Data-Structures-And-Algorithms/) I came across another free eBook which looks great for those interested in the details of algorithms, called [Data Structures and Algorithms](http://dotnetslackers.com/projects/Data-Structures-And-Algorithms/) by [Granville Barnett](http://msmvps.com/blogs/gbarnett/) and [Luca Del Tongo](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/wetblog/Default.aspx) and is hosted on [DotNetSlackers](http://dotnetslackers.com/projects/Data-Structures-And-Algorithms/). The book is a free PDF download.

As a long-time developer this is the type of information we learned in college and don't get a lot of coverage today. I feel this is fundamental to good programming and really understanding how things in our line of work functions. I am looking forward to reading this and providing some feedback here.

From the Granville's blog:

> This is a little project that myself and <a>Luca</a> have been working on in our spare (spare) time in the last month or so. The book is no where near complete but we wanted to get it out there now and progress with it in view of the public eye rather than just sit on it and wait months until it was a lot more thorough.
> 
> As this is just a preview don't expect it to be all finely polished, we know what we are lacking in terms of explanations. No chapter in the preview is the final version of that respective chapter. It's also worth mentioning that this is not the final list of chapters.
> 
> Our intended target audience are those who know how to use their respective language of choice, other than that you should be OK to follow the book. We have intentionally tried to keep the book compact and to the point.
> 
> The book is language independent. We use a form of pseudocode for all algorithms as such these algorithms can be easily ported to most imperative languages like C++, C#, and Java.

I think this is certainly worth checking out.
