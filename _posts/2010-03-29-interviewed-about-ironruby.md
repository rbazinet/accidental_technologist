I was recently [interviewed by Mike Pontacooloni of SearchWinDevelopment.com](https://searchwindevelopment.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid8_gci1507496,00.html) for an article about IronRuby and how it may be used by developers. I was asked about IronRuby since I use both .NET, IronRuby and Ruby on Rails in my day-to-day work and Mike thought I might have some insight into how .NET developers would likely use IronRuby to supplement their .NET toolbox.

I think the article gives some good perspectives by a number of .NET and Ruby developers.

Mike and I had a discussion a few weeks ago and the article was published today. Please [give it a read](https://searchwindevelopment.techtarget.com/news/article/0,289142,sid8_gci1507496,00.html).
