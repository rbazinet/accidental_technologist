**UPDATE**: I have been adding new sessions below as they have been posted from Stanford.

[![stanford-learning](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/LearniPhoneDevelopmentforFree_9802/stanford-learning_thumb.png "stanford-learning")](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/LearniPhoneDevelopmentforFree_9802/stanford-learning_2.png) My recent journey to learn some iPhone development, like what seems to be half the population of the planet, I came across a great resource for learning. Many universities are putting their courses on-line and making them free these days and Stanford University is no different, offering a totally free course on iPhone development aptly titled [iPhone Application Programming](https://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/itunes.stanford.edu.2024353965.02024353968). The [syllabus is available for the 10-week course](https://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/syllabus.php) on the Stanford site as well.

As the time I am writing this there are 13 lectures available to download from the iTunes store:

1. **Introduction to Mac OS X and Cocoa Touch** : Evan Doll provides an overview for the Stanford Computer Science department course, iPhone Application Programming.
2. **Using Objective-C, Foundation Framework** : Alan Cannistraro provides an overview of object oriented programming, the objective-C programming language, and common foundation classes.
3. **Custom Classes, Memory Management, and ObjC Properties** : Evan Doll discusses custom classes, object lifecycles, autorelease, and properties.
4. **Interface Builder, Controls, Target-Action** : Alan Cannistraro discusses the interface builder, controls, and target-action.
5. **Views and Drawing, Animations** : Alan Cannistraro covers views, drawing, and animation.
6. **View Controller Basics** : Evan Doll outlines designing iPhone applications, goes on to discuss the model-view-controller paradigm, and explores view controllers.
7. **Navigation Controllers** : Evan Doll covers navigation and tab bar controllers.
8. **Table Views** : Guest lecturer Jason Beaver from the Apple User Interface Kit (UIKit) team covers scroll views and table views.
9. **Dealing with Data: User Defaults, SQLite, Web Services** : Evan Doll discusses data in your iPhone application.
10. **Performance and Threading** : Alan Cannistraro covers application performance.
11. **Text Input, Presenting Content Modally** : Evan Doll covers text input and presenting content modally.
12. **Address Book: Putting People in Your App** : Alex Aybes discusses interfacing with contacts in the address book.
13. **Debugging Tips, Searching, Notifications, KVC/KVO** : Alan Cannistraro covers searching and notifications.
14. **Touch Events and Multi-Touch** : Steve Demeter shares his experience in creating the popular game applications, Trism. Josh Shaffer follows with a overview of touch-events and multi-touch.
15. **iPhone Device APIs: Location, Accelerometer &amp; Camera, Battery Life &amp; Power** : Justin Santamaria, from the iPhone Software Engineering team, provides an overview of the iPhone device APIs.
16. **Audio APIs, Video Playback, Displaying Web Content** : The lecture today covered audio, video and web APIs available on the iPhone. We also touched on settings bundles and some additional view transitions.
17. **Creating New Expressive Social Mediums on the iPhone** : Ge Wang, co-founder of Smule and developer of Ocarina and Leaf Trombone, spoke at length today on metaphors for the iPhone and creating expressive social mediums for the phone.
18. **Unit Testing, Localization &amp; More :** Evan covered unit testing, how to have some fun (and either impress your friends or crash your app) with Objective-C, localization and some common questions that we've been asked

I have gone through several of these and they are really very good. We are fortunate to have a resource like this without cost.

A few bonus talks were also included from some folks who already have iPhone applications developed:

- **Loren Brichter on Tweetie** : Loren Brichter shares his experience in developing Tweetie, the most successful paid social networking application.
- **How to Build an iPhone App that Doesn't Suck! (In 10 Easy Steps)** : Steve Marmon discusses the iPhone User Interface guidelines and proposes ten steps for the application development process.
- **From Upstart to Startup to Grownup: Lessons Learned in the First Year of an iPhone Company** : Jessica Kahn, the Director of Engineering at Tapulous, describes her experience at an iPhone application development company.
- **Optimizing OpenGL for iPhone** : Tim Omernick from the popular gaming company, ngmoco, provides a broad overview of OpenGL on the iPhone.

All of the materials from the course are available from the [class site at Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/index.php). This seems like a great resource to anyone starting out in iPhone development and either cannot get the time away.
