It's been a while since I had the time to post anything but I wanted to share this great summary post by Chris Risner of the Microsoft Azure team where he is focused on mobile.

Chris blogs each day in January about a specific topic iOS developers may face in their applications. ?The post is titled [31 Days of iOS](http://chrisrisner.com/31-Days-of-iOS) and each post is a detailed tutorial on a specific topic that day. ?
