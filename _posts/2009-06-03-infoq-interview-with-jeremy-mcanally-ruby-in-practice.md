[![mcanally_cover150](http://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/InterviewRubyinPracticewithJeremyMcAnall_AB07/mcanally_cover150_thumb.jpg "mcanally_cover150")](http://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/InterviewRubyinPracticewithJeremyMcAnall_AB07/mcanally_cover150_2.jpg) Just wanted to point out my interview with Rubyist, [Jeremy McAnally](http://www.jeremymcanally.com/) is up on InfoQ. The interview covers Jeremy’s new book, [Ruby in Practice](http://manning.com/mcanally/). I really love talking to other Rubyists and my role at InfoQ let me do this. I usually learn a few things from every interview, whether it be the perspective they see in Ruby, the future of Ruby or some obscure feature I wasn’t aware of before. In this case I really like Jeremy’s perspective of Ruby in the enterprise.

The interview also includes exclusive access to [Chapter 5 : Web Services](http://www.infoq.com/resource/articles/ruby-in-practice/en/resources/RiPChapter5.pdf) from the book. Readers interested in how to make best use of RESTful web services, SOAP and legacy system integration with Ruby should give it a read.

Read the interview in its entirety on the InfoQ web site – [Ruby in Practice with Jeremy McAnally](http://www.infoq.com/articles/ruby-in-practice). Any feedback is surely welcome.
