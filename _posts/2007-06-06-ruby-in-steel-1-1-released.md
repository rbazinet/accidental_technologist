Version 1.1 of Ruby in Steel has been [released](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/Ruby-In-Steel-1-1-Now-Available). This is a [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) development environment that is an add-in to Visual Studio 2005 and becomes an integral part of the environment. I live in Visual Studio much of my day and being able to create Ruby and [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com/) applications within Visual Studio is really nice.

I have blogged about Ruby in Steel [recently](http://rbazinet.wordpress.com/2007/06/03/great-ruby-development-environment-for-windows/) and have been using the tool for a while now and really happy with it. I am also very happy with their support as well.

I can't say enough good things about how nice this environment makes life so nice for someone who primarily focuses on Visual Studio development but wants to do some Ruby and Rails development and get up-to-speed quickly. The integration with all the nice Rails-ish tools like Gem, Rake and Capistrano is a huge bonus.
