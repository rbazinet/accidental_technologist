I am a frequent reader of [Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com). I am also very intent on learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails for as a way to write new software. There is an [interesting post](http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.309321.3), I mean rant, over on the JOS site about one developers experience recently with Rails. I think it's worth taking a look at and hopefully drive some discussion. Since I have been a Microsoft developer and have taken on Ruby and Rails as a learning process it's good to see someone has problems with this framework. If the framework was thought to be perfect by everyone then striving to make it better would be less of a goal. IMHO.
