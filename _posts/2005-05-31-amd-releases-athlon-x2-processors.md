In case you haven't heard, [AMD released](https://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=3ZIM0BWZKO440QSNDBCCKH0CJUMEKJVN?articleID=163702141) their new Athlon X2 processors today. You can follow the link so I won't bore you with the details.

This is really exciting news since AMD is first to market with the new multi-core technology. Intel will follow but this really gives the development community something to look forward to.

Today's processors are great but, in my opinion, represents the end of the line for what is possible with a single CPU. Current processors can't really get must faster so we need more processors and in this case more cores on a single processor. This will force developers to be better at multiprocessing and multi-threading techniques and create some really fantastic applications. The possibilities are endless.
