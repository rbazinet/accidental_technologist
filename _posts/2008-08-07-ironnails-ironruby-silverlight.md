**UPDATE:** I had the chance to talk with Ivan about IronNails. Please read the [interview over on InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/08/ironnails).

As we see [IronRuby](http://www.ironruby.com) make progress within Microsoft, we are also seeing new projects pop-up as well. One such project I have noticed and wanted to share is [![Silverlight](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/IronNailsIronRubySilverlight_BA0F/Silverlight_thumb.jpg)](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/IronNailsIronRubySilverlight_BA0F/Silverlight_2.jpg)[IronNails](http://flanders.co.nz/2008/08/07/ironnails-introduction/), created and [opensourced by Ivan Porto Carrero](http://github.com/casualjim/ironnails). IronNails brings IronRuby and [Silverlight](http://silverlight.net/default.aspx) together implementing an MVC pattern, much like [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org).

> IronNails   
> =========
> 
> IronNails is a framework inspired by the Rails and rucola frameworks. It offers a rails-like way of developing   
> applications with IronRuby and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).   
> This framework uses the pattern Model - ViewModel - View - Controller (M-VM-V-C). It should be able to run on both WPF   
> and Silverlight.
> 
>   
> The idea is that the views can be created using a design tool like Blend for example and just save that xaml as is. The   
> designer should not need to use anything else than drag and drop to create a GUI design. The behaviors are then added to   
> the view by using predefined behaviors in the framework or by defining your own behavior.   
> The framework then generates a proxy for the view which will be used to transparently wire up the commands in the   
> behaviors to controller actions.

IronNails is in its infancy and is showing some good promise. [Follow the announcement](http://flanders.co.nz/2008/08/07/ironnails-introduction/) on Ivan's blog for more details and future updates.
