Matthew Dicks explaining so well, what we should all already know and strive to do:

> There is always someone better than you. The bar is always higher than you think. When you stop looking for and striving for that higher bar, you are doomed to remain far below it. Failure to seek out people better than you results in complacency, and complacency is the worst. Complacency produces mediocrity and a false sense of security. It results in an inability to see the scarcity of resources and increasing levels of competition in this world.

 It's true in the field of technology as it is in the rest of our lives. There are always better, smarter developers from whom we can learn. There are better and brighter people in every aspect of our lives, whether it be a better parent, better spouse or better handyman. We can learn from everyone; don't assume you know the most.
