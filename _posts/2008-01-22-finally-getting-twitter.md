[![twitter](https://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/twitter.gif)](https://www.twitter.com/)

I have been on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/) for quite a while now and was very uninvolved in the whole experience. I just didn't get it, but watching others and being more involved has a bell going off in my mind.

Twitter says they are:

> Twitter is a service for friends, family, and co?workers to communicate and stay connected through the exchange of quick, frequent answers to one simple question: **What are you doing?**

To me, this is not what Twitter is all about. This may be the original intention of it's creators but the people I follow are not using it this way. Twitter is not about "What are you doing?" but conversing with friends and like-minded people about things we are interested in and care about, whether it be work, hobbies or family. People don't want to know that I am taking a nap, eating lunch or emptying our dishwasher. People care about what is important to them, that's it.

The last month or so I have used Twitter more and more and with the additional use I am seeing the usage pattern that fits my style of working. It has been like a chat client for some conversations and short blog posts at other times.

I write for InfoQ as both a Ruby and .NET editor and I have gotten article ideas from the people I follow on Twitter. Some of the interactions I have with people I interview or write about are on Twitter where I can converse about the writing.

Come visit Twitter and follow me, I am on as rbazinet. Twitter is very convenient and productive for so many reasons but it is not about what I am doing.
