It has been a while since [RubyFringe](https://www.rubyfringe.com "RubyFringe"), but the first of the session videos are [up on InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/fernandez-sales-do-the-hustle "InfoQ"). The one is with our good friend [Obie Fernandez](https://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/) titled "Do the Hustle", which basically talks about the business-side of Ruby and Rails development. The summary of the session states:

> Obie Fernandez will leverage his experience successfully selling consulting services for both Thoughtworks and Hashrocket to help you with the following questions: How do I figure out how to price my services? How do I figure out the kind of work I want to sell? How do I write contracts and statements of work? What about proposals? And RFPs? How do I close the deal?

I attended the event and can vouch for the quality of the talk and the relevant content. Go watch it.
