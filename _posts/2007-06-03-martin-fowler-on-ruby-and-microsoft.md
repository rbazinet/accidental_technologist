In the event you are a Ruby enthusiast and have been living under a rock, Martin Fowler has an [interesting post](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/RubyMicrosoft.html) on his view of Microsoft's lack of open source support, their intent with Ruby and AlphaGeeks ramblings.

I don't know if I agree with all of his thoughts such as his pat-on-the-back of Sun and their brilliance with [JRuby](https://jruby.codehaus.org/), that is yet to be seen. I do think he points out some good observations about Microsoft's attempt at bringing Ruby and Python to the CLR and how these implementations will be handled. Hopefully Microsoft won't change Ruby in any way and will just support Ruby as Ruby.

Give the post a read if you get a chance, at least it's thought provoking.
