it is official, [Professional IronRuby](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-IronRuby-Aaron-Junod/dp/0470377089) published by [Wrox/Wiley](http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/) is finally looking like it is a real thing. A fellow developer noticed this on the Amazon web site and passed on to me today. I was not even aware it was up yet.

Aaron and I have a third author, [Dan Bernier](http://invisibleblocks.wordpress.com/), so this book cover will change a bit. I always seem to look grumpy when I get photos taken, maybe I don't like my pictures taken.
