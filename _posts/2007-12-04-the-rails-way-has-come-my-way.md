Yes, my copy of [The Rails Way](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321445619?tag=obiefernandez-20&camp=211493&creative=379977&linkCode=op1&creativeASIN=0321445619&adid=0KZJSW2V13JEPW38CFYN&) by [Obie Fernandez](https://jroller.com/obie/) arrived today via Fed Ex. My copy arrived by way of Obie as I was quoted in the back of the book describing what the Rails way means to me.

I just received the book so I can say much about it, other than after browsing through it. It does look like a great book and it covers Rails 2.0, the upcoming release. This is the first book I have seen covering Rails 2.o and looks to cover the more complex parts of Rails.

The forward is written by David H. Hanson and from the back cover:

- Increase your productivity as a web developer
- Realize the overall joy of programming with Ruby on Rails
- Learn what's new in Rails 2.0
- Drive design and protect long-term maintainability with TestUnit and RSpec
- Understand and manage complex program flow in Rails controllers
- Leverage Rails' support for designing REST-compliant APIs
- Master sophisticated Rails routing concepts and techniques
- Examine and troubleshoot Rails routing
- Make the most of ActiveRecord object-relational mapping
- Utilize Ajax within your Rails applications
- Incorporate logins and authentication into your application
- Extend Rails with the best third-party plug-ins and write your own
- Integrate email services into your applications with ActionMailer
- Choose the right Rails production configurations
- Streamline deployment with Capistrano

Thanks Obie! I am looking forward to digging in on this one.
