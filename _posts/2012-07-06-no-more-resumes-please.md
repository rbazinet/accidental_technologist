I'm sure like so many people I used to keep a [r?sum?](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sum%C3%A9) up-to-date but no longer. ?I don't think with social media and blogging that we need them today. ?The traditional r?sum? was a document which gave a history of the skills you posses, the jobs you've held, some banter about where I went to school and maybe a bit about the things I like to do when I am not working.

The traditional r?sum? seems like something I did a dozen years ago but not today. ?Do you? ?I [write a blog](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/), it has an [About Me page](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/about/), in fact you are reading it now. ?I also keep a [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rbazinet) updated with new skills and that profile pulls in content from sites such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/rbazinet). ?The profile also shows the interests I have by the groups I belong, both professional and personal.

So why do I or anyone else for the matter need to keep a r?sum? updated? ?I think all of the relevant information can be had right on the Internet with much more dynamic content than a?r?sum? in Word document format.

I laugh when I approach someone about a project and they ask me for one. ?I mean, seriously, do you really want one? ?Do you really expect me to have one or is this just a test to see if I am hip enough for your project? ?Or is that just a reflex from job interviews of a long time ago.

We can do better, stop the?r?sum? madness now. ?

It's all in good fun, I know some people don't even know what LinkedIn is, don't care about blogs or Twitter but a good number of us do. ?
