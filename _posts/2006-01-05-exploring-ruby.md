I started playing around with Ruby back in the fall to see what all the hype was about and learn a bit about a language that is not by Microsoft, not because I wanted to stay clear of Microsoft but to try something different. As I mentioned before my career has been with mainly Microsoft products.

I picked up a copy of [Programming Ruby](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html) from the [Pragmatic Programmers](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/index.html). This book seems to be the standard text on the subject. I also downloaded the most recent build of Ruby from <http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/>. I am currently running my tests on Windows an there is an installer for Ruby from [Ruby-winms32](http://www.garbagecollect.jp/ruby/mswin32/en/). Using the installer from Ruby-winms32 really makes the setup of Ruby on Windows very easy.

I am very used to the developer experience in Visual Studio.NET 2003/2005 and I am spoiled by it. As I started to look at Ruby I knew I needed to also look at an environment to use to hopefully allow me to write Ruby code as well as do some of the things I am used to like integrated debugging and visual design of web pages. I did a Google search and found that [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) has an add-in called [RDT - Ruby Development Tools](http://rubyeclipse.sourceforge.net/) which seems to do most of what I am looking for, most importantly the debugging aspect. I will try it out and report my findings.

For now I am writing Ruby code in [Notepad2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html), which thanks to [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/NewNotepad2WithRubySyntaxHighlighting.aspx), has Ruby syntax highlighting.

I also found a nice [Ruby tutorial and the ability to try Ruby online](http://tryruby.hobix.com/) without installing Ruby. This is great even to just to play around.
