I have been working diligently on a project for some time now and it's finally available. ?My company, [Still River Software](http://stillriversoftware.com), received approval from Apple last week for [Palliateive Symptoms Survey](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/palliative-symptoms-survey/id509228209?mt=8) to help doctors and caregivers provide better and faster care to their patients.

> Palliative Symptoms Survey is an application based on the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Survey (ESAS-r) which was developed to assist in the assessment of nine symptoms that are common in palliative care patients: pain, tiredness, drowsiness, nausea, lack of appetite, depression, anxiety, shortness of breath, and wellbeing There is also a blank scale for patient-specific symptoms.

The application is a native iPad application written in Objective-C with a back-end using Ruby on Rails. ? Please read a little bit [about the project on my company web site](http://blog.stillriversoftware.com/2012/03/28/palliative-symptoms-survey-hits-the-apple-app-store/).
