**UPDATE:** The conference sessions and the interviews will be up on the InfoQ site at www.infoq.com/rubyfringe. Look for them in the coming weeks.

Here is the gang from [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com) at the recent [RubyFringe](http://www.rubyfringe.com/) conference in Toronto with some additional folks:

From left to right - Werner Schuster (InfoQ), Tom Preston-Werner ([GitHub](http://www.github.com), Powerset), Floyd Marinescu (InfoQ), Joseph Hurtado (innocent bystander, photographer and Ruby fan), and myself.

I had a great time at RubyFringe this weekend and interview many speakers, 12 in total. InfoQ also taped all 20 sessions (Zed's included). This was my first trip to Toronto and loved the city which is truly an amazing city.

Thank you to Joseph for posting the photos which include the one above. The complete set shot can be found on [Joseph's Flickr page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/trumpetca/sets/72157606299780343/).
