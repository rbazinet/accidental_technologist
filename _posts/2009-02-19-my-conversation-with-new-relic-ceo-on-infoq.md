[![New-Relic-logo](http://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/MyConversationwithNewRelicCEOonInfoQ_1020C/New-Relic-logo_thumb.gif "New-Relic-logo")](http://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/MyConversationwithNewRelicCEOonInfoQ_1020C/New-Relic-logo_2.gif) My recent interview with [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/) CEO, [Lewis Cirne is now up on InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/02/new-relic-rpm12). I met Lewis at act\_as\_conference and chatted about the new release of RPM 1.2 which gives our Rails applications some great insight.

Please give it a read, I think it goes into some good detail what RPM can do for Rails developers. I am trying out the lite version in a personal project so I can give it a go for my client work.

The New Relic blog has the [announcement of the new features](http://blogs.newrelic.com/2009/02/rpm-version-12-now-available-great-new.html) in the event you donâ€™t know what I am referring to.
