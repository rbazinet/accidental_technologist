I came across a new Ruby on Rails podcast recently called [Rubyology](https://rubyology.com/) by Chris Matthieu who founded [Numly](https://numly.com/).

Chris's podcast include introductions and reviews to frameworks such as [Camping](https://redhanded.hobix.com/bits/campingAMicroframework.html) and [Hobo](https://hobocentral.net/) and include various screencasts showing their use and general Ruby and Rails techniques.

These podcasts run about 1/2 hour each and are very good, especially for a novice. The content is geared more toward development than another podcast I really enjoy, [Rails Podcast](https://podcast.rubyonrails.org/).
