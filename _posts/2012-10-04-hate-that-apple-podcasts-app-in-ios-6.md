I installed the Apple Podcasts app on my iPhone 4 to try it out when it was first released but it didn't resonate with me so I kept accessing my podcasts in the Music app.

After upgrading to iOS 6 I noticed podcasts were no longer accessible from the Music app, I was forced to use the Podcasts app. ?Frankly, the app is lousy with two icons for each podcast I listen to and it's hard to determine how much time is left in the current episode.

Thanks to a good friend on Twitter, I don't have to keep that lousy app and I can go back to the way it used to me. ?Follow these three easy steps:

1. Delete the Podcasts App on the iPhone (be sure you don't sync it back to the phone on the next sync).
2. If you are running the Music app, close it.
3. Now reopen the Music app and voila..podcasts are now back under the More button.

I really hate Apple pulling stuff like this.

Thanks Kevin for the tip.
