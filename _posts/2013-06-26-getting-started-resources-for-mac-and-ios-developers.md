Are you just getting started with Mac or iOS development? ?Maybe just trying to improve what you know? ?Here is a [great resource from Dave Mark](http://www.davemark.com/?p=1829). ?Everything is covered including blogs, conferences, forums and official Apple documentation.

> I went looking for a reasonably recently updated list of dev resources to link to from the article. Couldn?t find one I was happy with, then remembered that we included a pretty solid list at the end of the book Beginning iOS 6 Development. Since that list needed to be updated for the iOS 7 rev of the book, I thought, why not pop the list into a blog post. And here we are.

> At its core, programming is about problem solving and figuring things out. It?s fun, and it?s rewarding. But, at times, you will run up against a puzzle that just seems insurmountable?a problem that appears to have no solution. In those situations, it?s good to have friends in high places. This post outlines some resources you can turn to when you?re in a bind.

So add?[Resources for Mac and iOS Developers?](http://www.davemark.com/?p=1829)?to you reference list and be sure to check out the post comments for some other great resources.

Dave also has a great list of developer tools as well,?[Dave?s List: Apple Dev Tools?](http://www.davemark.com/?p=4981)
