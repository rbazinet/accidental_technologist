It seems I have been on Twitter for longer than anybody. ?Heck, when I started we didn't have no stinking graphical clients, it was done with SMS. ?

I have used many of the graphical Twitter clients on the Mac and some are nice but not the best fit. ?I won't bore you with the long history of my Twitter client usage, since this is not about me.

I do want to say I discovered a great client to use on my [iPhone](https://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/) and [iPad](https://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/ipad/) named Tweetbot by the lovely folks at Tapbots. ?I use both everyday and love them. ?Well, they recently offered people to try out the Tweetbot for Mac beta, I jumped right on and have been using it all day, everyday. ??

This week [Tapbots released the official version for the Mac](https://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/mac/) over on the [Mac App Store for a measly $20](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id557168941?mt=12). ?Sure, you can try to say it's too expensive but you obviously have no idea what it takes to write software and when the software is good?it's even harder. ?I rushed to give them my money.

[John Gruber echoes my sentiment exactly](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/18/tweetbot-mac):

> When a great iPhone app comes out, it?s easy to ask the developer to expand it to the iPad too, and then bring it to the Mac. You know what?s hard? Actually doing it. But Tapbots has done it with Tweetbot. $20 for a Twitter client? Damn straight. Screw the race to the bottom. I?m happy to pay for quality work.

Now, I can keep all of the things I do on Twitter nicely synced. ?Great stuff.
