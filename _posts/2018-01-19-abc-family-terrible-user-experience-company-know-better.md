Somehow I was added to an email list from ABC Family, specifically [Freeform](https://freeform.go.com/). This is a channel that airs children's TV shows. Much of their content is terrible but I'm not their target audience. I have been receiving emails about new programming being added to their lineup. Our daughter is now 18 and outgrew what they have to offer, so when their latest email came in, I decided to unsubscribe. Here is their message to me: ![2018 01 10 14 44 09](/assets/img/2018/01/2018-01-10_14-44-09.png "2018-01-10_14-44-09.png") This is terrible! This is a terrible experience as a user. Here's what bothers me:

1. I'm trying to unsubscribe from their mailing list. The title indicates I am being added to another list, a Do Not Email list. What?
2. They've recorded my request. Why? Don't procrastinate, do it now.
3. They need up to 10 business days to remove me, add me, or whatever for processing. 10 days? How are they handling my request, carrier pigeon? We've all belonged to email lists before, we know how unsubscribing should work..it should happen NOW.
 
 This single interaction with ABC Family has stuck in my mind for a while. It has left a lasting impression. Leave a positive lasting impression with your customers. If they decide they don't want to do business with you any longer, don't burn the bridge..maybe they'll be back at some other time. Maybe they will recommend you to a friend. If you burn bridges, they will be gone for good.
