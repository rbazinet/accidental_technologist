![Pr ruby](/assets/img/2011/03/pr-ruby.png "pr-ruby.png") I have had the opportunity recently to discuss Goliath, a new Ruby [application server from PostRank Labs](http://postrank-labs.github.com/goliath/), with its creator [Ilya Grigorik](http://www.igvita.com/). ?The article and interview titled,?[Meet the Goliath of Ruby Application Servers](http://www.infoq.com/articles/meet-goliath), is?now up on the InfoQ web site, please give it a read. ?I think it is a unique and very useful project worth giving a look. I was fortunate enough to have a look at the project before it was released and was able to work with it. ?I have to say that I am really excited about this project to solve some problems in my own work. ?I had previously thought of using [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) but was turned off by the thought of having to write some server-side JavaScript. Goliath uses Ruby 1.9+ to take advantage of fibers (continuations). ?This is one example why developers should be moving to Ruby 1.9.2 and beyond. ?Hopefully we see more projects like Goliath that take advantage of 1.9's features and prod developers to a better Ruby.
