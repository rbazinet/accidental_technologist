Happy New Year everyone! This is my first post of 2006 and will hopefully be the start of many more posts.

The New Year is a time to reflect back on the previous year and look forward to the next 12 months. I am sitting here trying to determine what is going to motivate me for the next year as I look out the window of 5" of new fallen snow.

My first task of 2006 is to go out and shovel the driveway and walkways of our new snowfall. Just trying to get motivated to do it.
