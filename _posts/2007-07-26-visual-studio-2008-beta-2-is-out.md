In case you missed it, Visual Studio 2008 Beta 2 along with the .NET Framework 3.5 is out.

[Scott Guthrie](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/07/26/vs-2008-and-net-3-5-beta-2-released.aspx) has a great overview of the changes and how to get it. If you don't want to travel all the way to Scott's site, you can find the installation versions of VS 2008 [here](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa700831.aspx).

My favorite way to check out versions of Visual Studio or any major beta software for that matter is through a pre-built VPC. I have found them over [here](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=3b72271c-e996-4989-898d-72d684966ce6&displaylang=en&tm). You have to download 8 files (2 executables and 6 .rar files), you run one of the executables and it creates a nice VPC you can use with with Virtual PC or Virtual Server. It certainly makes a lot less work by not having to install all of this software and it also keeps my system clean.

I downloaded all the files, ran the executable and had my VPC up and running in only a few minutes (after the long downloads but who cares).

I am anxious to try out the new Multi-platform target support and Intellisense with JavaScript.
