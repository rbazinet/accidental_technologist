The first Hartford, CT Code Camp [has been announced](https://blogs.msdn.com/cbowen/archive/2008/06/30/upcoming-northeast-developer-events-july.aspx) and is scheduled for Saturday August 16, 2008. Details are limited but some information is available.

> A code camp is a FREE, community-driven, all-day event for developers. Speakers are local or regional developers. Topics are based on community interest. Sessions are original and feature a heavy technical focus (no marketing fluff). We will follow the Spirit of the Codecamp Manifesto as described here - <https://www.thedevcommunity.org/codecamps/manifesto.aspx>

### Location: 

> To be held at New Horizons Computer Learning Center (Bloomfield CT)   
> <https://www.newhorizons.com/content/centerSearchResults.aspx?SiteId=25>

### Time:

> CTDOTNET CodeCamp - Hartford CT (Saturday Aug 16th 9AM-5PM)

There is an open [call for speakers right now](https://weblogs.asp.net/sbchatterjee/archive/2008/07/01/call-for-speakers-the-first-hartford-codecamp-aug-16th-sat.aspx) so head over and sign up to speak.

> We are seeking talented .NET developers to make a presentation or two at the First Hartford CodeCamp on August 16th (Saturday). If you have ever wanted fame (&amp; perhaps fortune) - this is your opportunity! We are giving away one MSDN Premium subscription and other prizes for presenters (judged by evals from attendees).
> 
> Each session should be about 90mins in duration and the content should be on developer topics that would be of interest to attending developers. Just about anything in .NET and other Microsoft technologies!
> 
> Choose a .NET topic of interest and send a brief abstract or outline, your developer experience, expected audience level, etc or any other questions to <ctdotnet@gmail.com>
