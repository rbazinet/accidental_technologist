I didn?t code, or design, on the evening machine if I could possibly help it ? and since I work from home, the big desktop was always within reach.

 I've been using the new MacBook for the better part of a month and haven't had much time to write a review just yet, but it's coming. Matt?s post pretty much reflects my experience with the new laptop. It's great and the new keyboard and trackpad are fantastic. The keyboard worked for me almost instantly. I had gone into it with the idea I wasn?t going to like it. [Marco Arment?s post about the MacBook](http://www.marco.org/2015/05/19/mistake-one)?came out while my MacBook was on order so I had some doubts. I have a different use-case with the MacBook. I *am* a developer, unlike Matt. I use Xcode and Sublime Text for Ruby development. I have no problems using the little MacBook for the projects I build. I use both Xcode 6 and 7. I don?t baby the laptop, often have PostgreSQL running alongside an instance or two of Sublime Text and an Xcode IDE up and running. Works great. No, it?s not as fast as my main machine, an iMac 5K, but I didn?t expect it to be either.
