On the heels of the Rails 1.1 release, [Instant Rails 1.1](https://instantrails.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl) was released.

For those of you who donâ€™t know, Instant Rails allows Windows users to have a complete environment to develop and test Ruby and Rails code without having to install and configure each necessary component on your own. Instant Rails provides:

- Ruby 1.8.4
- Rails 1.1
- Apache
- MySQL

All are configured and ready to go. I have been using this environment on my Windows systems for quite a few months now and the support has been great. The environment encapsulates everything so well that there is no interference with any other applications to be concerned with.
