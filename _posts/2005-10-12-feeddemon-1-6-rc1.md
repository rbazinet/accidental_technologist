Newsgator has released FeedDemon 1.6 RC1 to their [beta download site](http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/beta/). I have been using FeedDemon since the early 1.6 beta and it has gotten better and better. I think the performance has gone up all around in each beta. It seems to be the best Windows Forms-base aggregator out there, in my opinion.
