Microsoft announced today information about an initiative for supporting Asynchronous JavaScript (AJAX) in ASP.NET 2.0. AJAX is not a new technology but has been used recently by such companies as Google in Google Maps and GMail. AJAX allows client-side script to make calls to the web server without issuing a postback and therefore making the user experience much smoother and more enjoyable.

[Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2005/06/28/416185.aspx) is the person inside of Microsoft who is responsible for incorporating such technologies. You can read more on his weblog for more information.
