I have been running [GraffitiCMS](https://www.graffiticms.com) from [Telligent](https://telligent.com/) for a few months now and everything has run pretty smoothly with some small exceptions which Telligent has fixed in their latest release.

Graffiti can't do everything people want so they have opened up their product to extension developers to create some nifty plug-ins to extend Graffiti. I have been using a few of them and found myself either finding a couple bugs in the tools or needing to further extend their functionality. I have either been given commit rights to the code repositories or sent fixes to the authors. This is this first time I have really taken part in open source development and it feels pretty good to do something and give it away, back to the community.

So, just to give a little shout-out to the projects which trusted my code changes to be part of their updates:

### Graffiti Extras

[Graffiti Extras](https://www.codeplex.com/GraffitiExtras) has the largest number of plug-ins and was developed primarily by [Keyvan Nayyeri](https://nayyeri.net/blog/graffiti-extras-1.2-released/):

- **Sitemap plug-in**
- **Waegis plug-in**
- **Mobile Theme Selector plug-in**
- **Pingomatic plug-in**
- **RSS Extender plug-in**
- **Comment Reply Notifier plug-in**
- **IP Blocker plug-in**
- **Community Credit plug-in**
- **Sharing extension**
- **Community Reactions extension**
- **Post Navigator extension**
- **Search Relevancy extension**
- **Theme Explorer extension**
- **Poll Manager widget**
- **Underground theme**
- **Windows Mobile theme**

### Graffiti Redirect

[Graffiti Redirect](https://code.google.com/p/graffiti-redirect/), developed by James Avery, is a plug-in to redirect an old blog to a new Graffiti-based blog. This tool has been a lifesaver to me.

### Twitter &amp; RSS Plugins

These [two plug-ins](https://simpable.com/code/twitter-and-rss-plugin/) were developed by Scott Watermasysk to notify Twitter when a new post is published to your Graffiti blog and fills in a missing piece of Graffiti.

It was a really good experience helping out even the little bit I did to these open source products. I am a true believer in the power of open source to help continually develop a product that may not otherwise have a chance. I am going to actively pursue other projects I feel passionate about and give to them now and in the future, I encourage others as well.
