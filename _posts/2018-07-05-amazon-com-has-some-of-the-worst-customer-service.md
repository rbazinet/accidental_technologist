The title says it all, Amazon.com provides some of the worst customer service. Just try to contact them and see for yourself. They are so big that they create their own rules and we have to live by them. I placed an order last night and here is the email I received this morning: ![image](/assets/img/2018/07/2018-07-05_13-27-04-1024x658.png) I never contacted Amazon about unauthorized activity on my account. When I called their Customer Service, they could provide no good explanation other than I placed an order for a higher dollar amount than usual and this was the way they ensured I was being protected. This was for MY benefit. The order was cancelled, my account was locked and all of my payment methods removed. I think Amazon expects that I should be grateful for their astute attention to security. It's now up to me to change my password after 5 hours, add my payment accounts back in and recreate the order they deleted. This is how Amazon treats customers. I've been placing thousands of dollars worth of orders for years with never a problem, until Amazon thinks I ordered something too high priced. I've been contacted by the fraud department of my credit card companies before; some was valid fraud while others were my purchases. The process was simple, they sent a text or called me to verify the purchase. I like this feature, it's saved me. Amazon saved nothing but added aggravation. I'd love to have another place to order from for the items we need. Amazon is getting too big and we need other options. If we had real options, I would take my business elsewhere today. I know they wouldn't care but if enough people did this, then they might.
