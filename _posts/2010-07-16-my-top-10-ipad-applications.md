I know more and more people who are buying iPads almost daily. I get asked what applications I recommend for the device. [![things_hero_20100616](/assets/img/2010/07/things_hero_20100616_thumb.jpg "things_hero_20100616")](/assets/img/2010/07/things_hero_20100616.jpg)

First, I don?t use a tool because of cost, I use it for it?s usefulness to me. Free is great, but never the top requirement when searching out a piece of software for my iPad. So, here is the top 10 applications I use:

1. [TweetDeck](https://www.tweetdeck.com/ipad/) (Free) ? I use Twitter a lot and use this software exclusively from my laptop and the iPad version functions the same so it is a nice extension from the MacBook Pro. Note: at this time the software is not without one annoying flaw; when opening links from a tweet, the app will often crash, other times not but it can be a pain.
2. [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswireapp.com/ipad/) ($9.99) ? I keep up with a fair amount of RSS feeds and this software syncs with Google Reader which I use daily on my laptop. It is a nice rich-client which keeps Google Reader up-to-date and has a nice UI to boot.
3. [GoodReader](https://www.goodreader.net/goodreader.html) ($0.99) ? I read a lot of books, which is one reason I bought the iPad. This utility makes reading PDF?s enjoyable. Dropbox integrates nicely with it to, allowing me to keep my PDFs on Dropbox.
4. [SimpleNote](https://simplenoteapp.com/) (Free) ? This does just what it says, simple notes. This is like having a little notepad always ready but the beauty is it syncs to an online service to get your notes from any browser.
5. [iSSH](https://www.zinger-soft.com/iSSH_features.html) ($9.99) ? It?s really nice to have the iPad 3G to have connectivity almost anywhere and when accompanied by a great SSH utility like this I can SSH into all of my servers with ease. One more reason not to carry the laptop.
6. [BlogPress](https://blogpress.coollittlethings.com/) ($2.99) ? I don?t write long emails or blog much from the iPad but this tool integrates nicely with Wordpress and makes those short post really easy. Lots of features for the regular blogger.
7. [Penultimate](https://www.cocoabox.com/) ($2.99) ? Great utility for mocking up ideas, taking notes or just a brain dump. Drawing on the iPad surface with my finger is super easy and no delays.
8. [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/iphone) ($4.99) ? This is a great service which is used in all of my browsers to bookmark web pages I want to go back and read later. The iPad version makes reading on the device really slick.
9. [BeejiveIM](https://www.beejive.com/ipad/) ($9.99) ? A great way to keep in touch with remote workers and other contacts is of course IM and unfortunately I am on a few but this tool keeps them all in one place with the exception of Skype which I hope gets added soon. A runner-up to this tool is [IM+](https://www.shapeservices.com/en/products/details.php?product=im&platform=iphone) ($9.99, Free Lite Version) which does offer Skype IM integration but the UI is not as refined.
10. [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/ipad/) ($19.99) ? I use this to-do list on my MacBook Pro, iPhone and now the iPad to manage projects with a nice clean interface. The mobile devices sync back to the MBP and keeps everything in order. I have to say the entire suite is a bit pricey compared to other iPhone and iPad applications out there but for something I use all the time, worth it.
 
Bonus - [Netflix](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/netflix/id363590051?mt=8) (Free) ? this is really the only entertainment type application on this list and after a long day of working it is often nice to pull up a movie or TV episode. The quality of video is exceptional.

I can?t think of a replacement for any of these tools just yet. I have tried their competitors but these stick as my favorites and most useful.
