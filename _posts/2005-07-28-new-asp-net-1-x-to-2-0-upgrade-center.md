Microsoft has just released a new section of the MSDN web site for those developers upgrading from ASP.NET 1.x to ASP.NET 2.0. [Check it out.](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/migration/upgrade/default.aspx)

A couple of the articles I found most interesting:

- [Common ASP.NET 2.0 Conversion Issues and Solutions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/migration/upgrade/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnaspp/html/upgradingaspnet.asp)
- [Migrating from ASP.NET 1.x to ASP.NET 2.0](http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/migration/upgrade/default.aspx?pull=/library/en-us/dnvs05/html/migratefromaspnetto2.asp)

My day job includes a mix of C# development on .NET 1.1 and 2.0 with most development moving to 2.0 in the near future. We use [Telerik](http://www.telerik.com/) radControls for much of our ASP.NET user interface and Telerik has yet to give us a set of controls we can use with VS 2005. Once this occurs we will probably converting all of our existing ASP.NET 1.1 code to 2.0.
