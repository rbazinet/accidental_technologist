![Bootstrapping2](/assets/img/2013/05/bootstrapping2.jpg "bootstrapping2.jpg")

I love podcasts. ?I listen to them in the car, walking or sometimes even when working. ?I can't get enough of the good ones and you probably can't either.

Since attending [MicroConf](http://www.microconf.com/) last week I can't stop thinking about creating products, recurring revenue and talking about all the facets of running a product business.

I thought I would pull together my short list of the podcasts for boots trappers, entrepreneurs, startups or whatever you might call yourself, that I listen to and gain value. Some of these I have just recently discovered, while others, I have been a fan since their inception. ?

If there are some podcasts that should be on this list, please feel free to point them out in the comments.

I hope you find as much value in these as I do:

### Startups for the Rest of Us

[Rob Walling](http://www.softwarebyrob.com/) and [Mike Taber](http://www.singlefounder.com/), creators of [MicroConf](http://www.microconf.com/)?have been producing this podcast for a long time. ?[Startups for the Rest of Us](http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/) is exactly what it sounds like, a podcast for regular people trying to startup a business. ?

The format of the show begins with Rob and Mike talking about what's going on with their own businesses and related products. ?Each show follows a theme where the duo discusses the focused topic. ??

### Bootstrapped.fm

[Ian Landsman](http://twitter.com/ianlandsman) of HelpSpot fame and [Andrey Butov](http://twitter.com/andrey_butov)?recently started [Bootstrapped.fm](http://bootstrapped.fm/) and after listening to a few episodes I find myself looking for new episodes in iTunes.??

The format of each episode is similar to Startups for the Rest of Us, where Ian and Andrey discuss their bootstrapping adventures. ?It's nice to hear different aspects of different types of bootstrapped software businesses, Ian with his SaaS application and Andrey with mobile applications. ?

Lots of topics crossover, whether doing SaaS or mobile applications but there's always valuable lessons to learn.

### Bootstrapped with Kids

[Bootstrapped with Kids](http://www.bootstrappedwithkids.com/) ?is also a recent addition to my podcast collection. ?[Brecht Palombo](http://brechtpalombo.com)?is the host and?who also gave a great attendee talk at MicroConf.?

The topics are dear to the hearts of boostrappers and include product ideas and other aspects of the trade.

### Product People

[Kyle Fox](http://kylefox.ca/) and [Justin Jackson](http://justinjackson.ca/about)?are the hosts of [Product People](http://productpeople.tv), a podcast I only recently discovered. ?It is quickly becoming one of my favorites. ?

The interviews are with, you guessed it, people who are successful product builders. ?The interview style is very dynamic and doesn't follow a script as you might have heard in other interview format podcasts. ?I continually find myself thinking of the questions I would ask the guests and as it happens, these guys are asking those questions. ?I'm sure the people who see me walking each day and nodding my head in agreement think I'm crazy.

Some recent interviewees include:

- Amy Hoy
- Nathan Barry (two parts and fantastic)
- Hiten Shah
- Jason Fried
- Brennan Dunn
- Rob Walling
- Patrick McKenzie

### Mixergy

[Mixergy](http://mixergy.com/) is actually an old favorite I have mentioned here before. ?[Andrew Warner](https://twitter.com/AndrewWarner) does a fantastic job of interviewing entrepreneurs from all different industries and all different stories. ?

Andrew is the marathon man of podcasting with tons of episodes and counting. ?Plenty of backlog to go through and enjoy.

If you prefer the episodes are online and can watch the videos of Andrew interviewing his guests. ?The benefit is see the guests facial expressions, small but nice sometimes.

### Kalzumeus Podcast

[Patrick McKenzie](http://www.kalzumeus.com/blog/)?is a highly respected bootstrapped entrepreneur in the software industry who speaks at a few conferences and draws a crowd. ?Patrick has discussions with various entrepreneurs ranging from angel investing to sales and marketing. ?The episodes are not very frequent but they are solid and very much worth the wait. ?Patrick includes [transcripts in the podcast page](http://www.kalzumeus.com/category/podcasts/) so if you would rather digest the great material at a slower pace, it's there.

### Entrepreneur on Fire

This is another relatively new discovery for me. ?The format is a series of interviews with entrepreneurs who have a wide range of skills, backgrounds and business types. ?[Entrepreneur on Fire](http://www.entrepreneuronfire.com/) is a very active podcast and publishing episodes at a feverish pace (5 days a ?week), not sure I can keep up.
