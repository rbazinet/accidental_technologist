![Mohammad metri 1oKxSKSOowE unsplash](/assets/img/2020/02/mohammad-metri-1oKxSKSOowE-unsplash.jpg "mohammad-metri-1oKxSKSOowE-unsplash.jpg") I listen to many podcasts. I have some I've followed for years. I have some I add to my favorite podcast app on my iPhone, hear a couple of episodes, and remove. The number one reason I unsubscribe; the hosts are wasting my time. I don't have much time each day for podcasts, and when I turn them on, I would like to get right to the details. I don't want to list those that I have problems with because I don't want to call anyone out. Those that waste time know who they are. Examples of wasting my time: - Casual banter. Carrying on about the trip you took or the co-working space you visited adds no value. It's not the reason I am listening to your podcast. Get to the point.
- Complaining - many do it, complaining about something unrelated to the topic isn't adding value to the show.
- Personal discussions are unrelated to the topic I tuned into in the first place.
- Your world philosophy - podcasts tend to be a soapbox for some folks, it's really not the place.
 
 Examples of who does it right: - [Hanselminutes](https://hanselminutes.com/), Scott Hanselman adds no fluff to his 1/2 hr with listeners. He values their time, and it shows.
- [Rails with Jason](https://www.codewithjason.com/rails-with-jason-podcast/)
- [Ruby on Rails Podcast](https://5by5.tv/rubyonrails)
 
 I don't know why so many podcasters do this. I can only imagine they think they need to fill more time in the show. I'd rather have a short show on-topic than a longer show with talk. I believe shows that run 60 minutes could easily shorten to 30-40 with being on topic Maybe they think we are interested in their personal stories. Sorry, but I'm not. Podcasters, value the time of the listener. Address the topic with spot-on discussions and remove the filler. No fluff, just stuff.
