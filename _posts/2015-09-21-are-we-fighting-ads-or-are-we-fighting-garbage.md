[John Gruber is right](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/19/nyt-ad-blockers-ios-9): > If you want to block all advertising, I don't understand you, but I won't argue with you either. No one's going to stop you. But most people just want to block garbage privacy-invasive trackers, JavaScript that slows our devices and drains our batteries, obtrusive ads that cover the content we're trying to read. Are we fighting ads, or are we fighting garbage?

 [I'm on the side of content blockers](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/technology/taking-the-side-of-the-content-blockers/) and agree with John. When it comes to blocking ads, this is the feature of content blockers that appeals most to me. Truth be-told, I don't mind good, targeted ads that introduce me to great products and services. The garbage ads are the ones that offend me. The ads the pop-up modally and force me to wait to close, for me to read them. These are the ads I want the option to block. I'm in the fighting garbage camp but how would this be distinguished? How is a content blocker now supposed to show me ads someone has deemed quality? I'm not sure this is not just another can of worms.
