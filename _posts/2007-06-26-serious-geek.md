I work with smart people everyday but the number of times I meet or hear about a real [geek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek) seem much more rare.

Here is a link from [John Lam's blog](https://www.iunknown.com/) about [Steve Yegge who ported Rails](https://www.iunknown.com/2007/06/steve-yegge-por.html), yes as in Ruby on Rails, to JavaScript. I work with JavaScript but can't say I really enjoy it, this guy must love it to take on a project like this.

Steve works at Google and wanted to use Ruby on Rails, but Google is not a Ruby shop but they use JavaScript, so Steve decided to port Rails to JavaScript. This is very cool, it would be interesting to see how well it works.
