Today was the second and final day of RubyFringe. I only had the opportunity to listen to a couple speakers today because I was busy all day interviewing some of the speakers from the conference for [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/).

Check out [a post from the Unspace](http://rethink.unspace.ca/2008/7/20/we-are-rubyfringe) folks discussing the conference.

### The Speakers

#### [Geoffrey Grosenbach](http://nubyonrails.com/)

Geoffrey is a well-known personality in the Ruby community and is a very entertaining speaker. He showed up to speak to us in a kilt which was very surprising and made him stand out very much.

His talk was really good and covered many of the things we as developers take for granted and the roots of our thoughts in philosophy. I enjoyed the talk immensely.

#### [John Lam](http://www.iunknown.com/)

John is one of my favorite speakers and personalities because he is smart and his talks are well thought out. John is a good sport about things and showed it with his entrance to his talk when the lights went down and the music used when Darth Vader used to enter the scene in Star Wars. It was totally fitting for a conference where Ruby and open source is the theme and Microsoft is evil. The crowd loved it and cheered John's humor.

His talk was around his past and the different projects he took on his path to IronRuby.

### Interviews

Sunday was all about interviews and that's what the InfoQ team did today. We conducted 10 videotaped interviews for InfoQ. I took care of 5 of them and I have to say they were a lot mentally harder than I expected, I was exhausted afterwards. I had a good group of interviewees and learned a lot more about each of them.

- [John Lam](http://www.iunknown.com/)
- [Jay Phillips](http://jicksta.com/)
- [Dan Grigsby](http://www.unpossible.com/)
- [Luke Francl](http://railspikes.com/)
- [Matt Todd](http://maraby.org/)

These interviews will be transcribed and up on InfoQ in the next three weeks or so. I hope each one is worth the price of admission.

I learned a ton here this weekend but more importantly I met a lot of people and had the chance to get to know them. I really enjoy these smaller venues where you can really have a good time without too much going on. Unspace did a great job of organizing this conference, bringing in great speakers and keeping everything running smoothly.

The evening ended with a good dinner and great conversation. I hope there is a RubyFringe next year and I have the opportunity to attend.
