I had a great interview with [Nate Kohari](https://kohari.org/), the creator of the [Ninject dependency injection framework](https://ninject.org/). The interview was for [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com) and of course, I think it's worth a read.

Ninject runs on a variety of .NET platforms:

- .NET Framework 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5
- .NET Compact Framework 2.0 and 3.5 (Ninject.Core and Ninject.Conditions)
- Silverlight 2.0 beta 2 (Ninject.Core, Ninject.Conditions, and all shipping extensions)

There are a few competing dependency injection frameworks available but this on seems to have a lot to offer and a strong following of developers using it. Nate even [has some swag](https://ninject.org/store), in case you might be looking for a shirt to help support his project.

You can [read the interview on the InfoQ web site](https://www.infoq.com/articles/ninject10-released).
