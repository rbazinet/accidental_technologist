In case anyone missed it, Microsoft released the [April CTP of Atlas](http://atlas.asp.net/default.aspx?tabid=47&subtabid=471), their Ajax toolkit. I have been using the last build to work through some test projects and the took kit is fantastic.

I know it has been reported the amount of the data is large for Atlas-enabled pages but the performance is good. I am sure Microsoft will optimize this as the debug code comes out and things will get smaller.

There are also some great [sample applications](http://atlas.asp.net/default.aspx?tabid=47&subtabid=471) available on the Atlas web site. Is anyone using this framework? If so, what are you building?

Rick Strahl has a great example of using Atlas for a chat web service [here](http://west-wind.com/weblog/posts/5139.aspx).
