I recently read a post over on [Scott Hanselman's blog](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheEndOfAdobeAcrobatThankYouFoxit.aspx) about [Foxit Software's PDF reader](http://www.foxitsoftware.com/default.htm). This is a PDF reader to replace Adobe Acrobat Reader. I have to admit, I HATE Adobe Acrobat Reader. It's slow, it's bloated, it stays in memory after use and it's unpredictable.

I have used Acrobat Reader for years and was relatively happy with it until after v3.0. Upon discovering the Foxit Software PDF Reader I decided to give it a try. I uninstalled my Adobe Acrobat Reader 6.02 with a small ceremony and unzipped my new Foxit PDF Reader looking for the install, and there was none. All that was enclosed in the zip was an .exe file. I copied the .exe to my path and gave it a shot by clicking on an existing PDF file.

**The Result**

It just worked. Windows recognized the .PDF was associated with the Foxit Reader with no problems. I opened IE and found a PDF on the web and loaded it, it just worked too. It was also very fast. When exiting IE the Foxit executable was gone from memory. This is how software should work.

I recommend replacing your bloated Adobe Acrobat as soon as possible and use the Foxit Reader. I am not affiliated with Foxit Software in any way, just thrilled to have found some great software.
