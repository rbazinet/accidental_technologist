I love finding great tools that solve problems I face everyday. I came across the [DevUtils.app](https://devutils.app/) recently which is a toolbox with lots of tools to make our day better.

Iâ€™ve made use of several of these and it works great.

The list of tools is pretty broad and I can imagine the author adding more to the toolbox as time goes on.

The toolbox is not free, $25 for use on two Macs. Seems like a bargain. I found the [source code is available too](https://github.com/DevUtilsApp/DevUtils-app) but I hope is if you find value, you support the author. As developers we know how much time it takes to create and support a nice piece of software.
