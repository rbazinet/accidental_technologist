I came across a really nice web site recently that is much like [Digg](https://www.digg.com) but for developers, called [Dzone](https://www.dzone.com/). The site is much like Digg in the way users are the ones who submit links to stories they think others will find useful. Users can then vote on those links to show their support for them. The one thing I really found useful about the site was their ability to "Tag" stories by topic. This allows the user to click on the tag on the side of the site to drill down on what is important to them.? Below you can see Dzone after I selected Ruby from the available tags on the right.? Very cool. ![dzone-ruby.jpg](https://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2006/08/dzone-ruby.jpg)? Technorati Tags : [Digg](https://technorati.com/tag/Digg), [Dzone](https://technorati.com/tag/Dzone)
