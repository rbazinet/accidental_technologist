Look at the news on [Chris Bowen's Blog : Major Visual Studio 2008 Announcements Today](https://blogs.msdn.com/cbowen/archive/2007/11/05/major-visual-studio-2008-announcements-today.aspx).

It looks like Visual Studio 2008 will be released to manufacturing by the end of November 2007. This will be great news and will assure my team we can continue with our .NET 3.5 work, knowing we can have a released development environment sooner rather than later. I was expecting Q1.

One thing that does make me wonder is why no updates released to beta testers since the July 2007 Beta 2?

I won't matter at the end of the month.
