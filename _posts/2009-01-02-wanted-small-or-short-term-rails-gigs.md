So, the title says it all. Right now I am finishing up my latest long-term project and I will have some time for some small projects. I am willing to work direct or possibly with other Rails consultants or consulting shops who want to bring someone in for a couple weeks or up to a couple months. I really don?t want to take on anything longer but would be willing to entertain a bigger project is it was the right thing to do.

I have been doing Rails applications for the past couple years and working with Ruby about as long. I don?t have any preference as to the type of application but given a choice I guess I would have to say back-end applications. I work out of my home office and have my development environment all setup so I need nothing in the way of software or equipment.

I also have a pretty extensive background it working with MySQL, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server as the data store.

So please send an email to rbazinet at stillriversoftware dot com if you are interested in chatting about your project and working together. If you know someone in need, please pass along my information to them.

Thank you.
