![Fathom analytics](/assets/img/2020/02/fathom-analytics.png "fathom-analytics.png") I've used Google Analytics for many years, and continuing because it's free. As time has gone on, I've decided to use Google products less and less. Google Analytics always seemed to be complicated or maybe overly complex for the pieces of data for which I care. It gives many details I have never used. ## Enter Fathom

 I started looking for an alternative analytics tool. I discovered [Fathom](https://usefathom.com). Fathom offers excellent features and the ones I care about most. I like to be able to see: - What are people reading?
- Where are they coming from?
- What is the visitor's geographic origination?
- What browser are visitors using?
 
 I did a quick informal survey of analytics tools on Twitter that resulted in a favorable response for Fathom. They offer a 7-day trial. - Fathom allows unlimited sites
- Privacy - they don't collect personal data
- Great support, yes, I know first hand. Quick, helpful replies.
- [Pricing](https://usefathom.com/pricing) is by total page views over all your sites.
 
## Installation

 Installation is simple, add a JavaScript snippet to each page or template to start tracking. If you use WordPress, there is a handy plugin that adds the [Fathom Dashboard to WordPress](https://usefathom.com/support/wordpress). One issue I had was getting the analytics dashboard to show up in Wordpress and making sure sharing is enabled. You need to tell Fathom to share data with Wordpress because it's an external site. Notice the setting, the default being **Viewable by You**. Change the setting to **Viewable to anyone with the share password**. ![IMG 0707](/assets/img/2020/02/IMG_0707.jpeg "IMG_0707.jpeg") If you ignore this setting, you won't see analytics in the Wordpress Dashboard, only a 404 error. ## Support

 I contacted Fathom support a couple of times, and they were quick to reply from both Twitter and email. A couple features were missing, and support informed me of their full pipeline where features are always being added. After using Fathom for the past few of weeks, it's a great solution, and happy I made the change. I purchased an annual plan. Glad to support an indie developer.
