I was supposed to be at [RailsConf](https://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/content/home) this year covering the event for [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com), but I am not there. Sometimes higher priorities overtake the things we would like to do and well, I am home.

One of the announcements I thought might be coming at the event was the release of Ruby on Rails 2.1 and sure enough, it was released. The [details are covered on the Riding Rails blog](https://blog.rubyonrails.com/2008/6/1/rails-2-1-time-zones-dirty-caching-gem-dependencies-caching-etc):

> Rails 2.1 is now available for general consumption with all the features and fixes we?ve been putting in over the last six months since 2.0. This has been a huge effort by a very wide range of contributors helping to make it happen.
> 
> Over the past six months, we?ve had 1,400 contributors creating patches and vetting them. This has resulted in 1,600+ patches. A truly staggering number. And lots of that has made it into this release.

> **New features**  
> The new major features are:

None of these features actually stand out as the killer feature for this release but is instead a bunch of steady, solid improvements. Installing the update went without a hitch and my applications on my development system all ran without issue.

Notice the Railscast that accompanies the bulleted points above, they make a nice touch.
