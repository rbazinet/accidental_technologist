I am not really a fan of marketing, most of it sounds so disingenuous. ?The best and most effective marketing is not seen, this occurs when you are marketing and no one can identify it as marketing.

I found a book by [Scott Stratten](http://www.unmarketing.com/) titled [UnMarketing: Stop Marketing. Start Engaging](http://www.amazon.com/UnMarketing-Stop-Marketing-Start-Engaging/dp/1118176286/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1334868863&sr=8-2) which teaches how to do it right, to be genuine. ?This book hits on so many points that are important to today's entrepreneurs that as I read it I just had nod my head over and over.

Some people claim not to be marketers, not to be sales people, but you are. ?Sorry to be the barer of bad news but you deal with people each day and are marketing yourself.

I'll admit I "read" Scott's book but I did it in the [audio version from Audible.com](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B004GLE9MO&qid=1334869146&sr=1-1) and I'm so glad I did. ?If I read the Kindle or printed edition it would have been in my voice and not Scott's. ?Scott is great narrator and very entertaining. ?It appears the book on [Amazon is a revised and updated](http://www.amazon.com/UnMarketing-Stop-Marketing-Start-Engaging/dp/1118176286/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) version but I think the material from Audible is so applicable today that it doesn't matter. ?Your mileage may vary of course.

When I think of traditional marketing I think of writing and sending press releases, sales pitches and all those things associated with the unpleasant part of selling a product. ?Scott takes the approach that has worked for me in acquiring new clients, low pressure and being yourself and helping people because you care about helping people.

Many of the things taught in this book seem to be obvious but so few people actually get it. ?Scott goes into great details on:

- How to build trust
- Examples of companies that don't get-it
- No cold calling
- Evaluation of the main social media services
- Fast and relevant interaction with an existing customer
- Tweeting just to tweet
- Transparency and authenticity (my favorite)
- so much more?

### Summary

I loved this book. ?I read a lot of books and I occasionally will point one out here but only if I really liked it. ?This book is one I really liked and continually get a lot out of.

This book is loaded with gems, some will apply to your business and some might not but I think there is something in here for everyone. ?Read this book and make our social media world a better place.

Scott also runs a [very good blog](http://www.unmarketing.com/) where he discusses various topics close to the book topics. ?Almost like a running errata list.
