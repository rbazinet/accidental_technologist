My appetite for podcasts is always growing but my interests routinely change.? I don?t listen to many .NET-specific podcasts any longer, but more along the lines of software craftsmanship, Mac/iPhone, Python and Ruby development.? I hike about an hour a day to try to stay somewhat fit and always have my iPhone loaded up with podcasts to pass the time. I am always searching for new podcasts and from time-to-time that I come across new ones I consider worth sharing. It has been a while since I have shared any, so now seems like as good a time as any.? My last update from a few years ago titled [Software Development Podcast List](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/podcast/software-development-podcast-list/) has seen a few additions.

### General Coding, Ruby on Rails, .NET

- [coderpath podcast](http://coderpath.com/) with Miles Forrest and Curtis McHale ? mainly interviews with Ruby on Rails community folks, great dialog.
- [Teach Me to Code podcast](http://teachmetocode.com/podcast/) with Charles Max Wood ? covers a wide variety of topics and interviews with community members from Agile to Ruby and everything in between.? Very good detailed discussions, highly recommended.
- [The Dev Show](http://5by5.tv/devshow) with Dan Benjamin and Jason Seifer ? news covering JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Java, PHP and more.
- [The Ruby Show](http://5by5.tv/rubyshow) with Dan Benjamin and Jason Seifer ? good review of the latest Ruby and Rails news, with a side of hate for MongoDB (just kidding).? Most episodes are 20-min or so in length.
- [The Changelog](http://thechangelog.com/) with [Adam Stacoviak](http://adamstacoviak.com/) ? very detailed interviews and discussions on more obscure subjects in Open Source including JavaScript, iPhone, Sinatra, node.js and others.? This podcast exposes listeners to subjects not really heard elsewhere.? Good stuff.
- [Herding Code Podcast](http://herdingcode.com/) with K. Scott Allen, Kevin Dente, Scott Koon and Jon Galloway ? originally mainly a Microsoft-centric podcast, lately they have been expanding into many great areas such as iPhone development, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, jQuery and more.? Great interviews by people really focused on technology.
- [Startups for the Rest of Us](http://www.startupsfortherestofus.com/) with [Rob Walling](http://www.softwarebyrob.com/) and Mike Taber ? not a developer podcast per se but a podcast about going out on your own from two software developer.? Truly valuable episodes if you are thinking about starting a software company or even if you have an idea for a product and wonder what to do.
- [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com/) with Gregg Pollack and Nathaniel Bibler ? great source of Ruby news in very short episodes (5-6 minutes).
 
### Open Source

- [FLOSS Weekly](http://twit.tv/FLOSS) with Randal Schwartz ? interviews with leaders in open source.? Great insight into great projects.
 
### Mac and iPhone/iPad

- [Core Intiution](http://www.coreint.org/) with Daniel Jalkut and Manton Reece ? includes many aspects of Mac development.
- [The Mac Developer Network](http://www.mac-developer-network.com/shows/podcasts/mdnshow/) ? covers a wide range of development topics for Mac, iPhone and iPad development.
 
### Screencasts

 Even though I don?t put screencasts on my iPhone, I do watch these in my free time on my Mac.? These are really good, so I wanted to share.? I didn?t really have enough to put in their own categories, so everything is just lumped together. - [RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com/) with Ryan Bates ? short (6-15min) screencasts covering very specific topics of Ruby on Rails development.? This is great for beginners and experienced developers alike who want to come up-to-speed on new topics like Rails 3 (222 episodes as of the time of this writing).
- [web pulp tv](http://webpulp.tv/) with Josh Owens ? very detailed interviews with many high-profile tech companies talking about how they approach a tech stack and make thing scale.
- [Teach Me to Code](http://teachmetocode.com/) with Charles Max Wood ? great how-to videos on various aspects of Rails, including Rails 3, RSpec and others.? These are very well done and worth watching for the latest.
 
 I am always looking for any other podcasts or screencasts covering unique topics.? Please leave a comment here with some I may not be including here and may enjoy.? Thank you.
