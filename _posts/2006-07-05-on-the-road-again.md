I have not posted to my blog in a while. I am sitting in a hospital room in Baltimore, MD running the night shift in my daughter’s room after her surgery. She has some issues with the growth of her bladder and the surgery is meant to help change that, but no guarantees. The 4 hour surgery was done on 6/30/2006. It may not seem like a long time but it is an eternity when you are waiting word from the doctors.

It’s interesting how being a parent makes one view life a bit differently. I can see the pain in her face as she tries to do the simple things she has always done. I would trade places with her in a minute. As of this writing she is 6 and 1/2 years old and very active. Her condition was from birth and we have been dealing with it since. Our doctor, Dr. John Gearhart, is the best doctor we could have at the best hospital, [Johns Hopkins](https://www.hopkinshospital.org/), in the country.

It is a bit difficult living in CT and traveling back and forth, but we manage. We are hoping to be released from the here tomorrow 7/5 or on 7/6. We will be heading to the Children’s House here in Baltimore for a few days to be close to the hospital while she heals.

I plan to get back to blogging soon, just haven’t had the time or the focus to write something worth reading.
