Well, after placing my order on January 20, 2008 my 1 TB Time Capsule has shipped today!

I am very anxious to get this little toy and be able to have Time Machine backup to my Time Capsule without me even thinking about it. I am planning to take a few pics of the unboxing, not because I really have to but because I have never done one of those lame unboxing posts.
