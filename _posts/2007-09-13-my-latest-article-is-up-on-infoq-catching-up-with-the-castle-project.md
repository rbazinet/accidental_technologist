My latest article titled "[Catching up with the Castle Project](http://www.infoq.com/news/2007/09/castleproject)" is up on the [InfoQ web site](http://www.infoq.com). I had the opportunity to chat with Hamilton Verissimo of the [Castle Project](http://www.castleproject.org/index.html).

I have been using this framework on some test projects to try to learn the .NET side of an MVC framework. The talk with Hamilton was loaded with incite, thank you Hamilton for giving me the time.
