The latest edition of the [Microsoft Architecture Journal #5](http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=journal.5&abver=E9A00024-3DC1-4B6A-BC20-22716E4D2FEA&id=) is out now. This is one of the best sources of the current state of systems architecture around and the price is right.

The [Microsoft Architecture Resource Center](http://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=home&abver=E9A00024-3DC1-4B6A-BC20-22716E4D2FEA) hosts this journal and also has a lot of great information on architecture subjects and links some blog worth reading.
