Have you ever wondered how some of your [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) friends have those cool cartoon versions of themselves? I was put onto one such service from one my Twitter friends.

The source I found recently was from a web site called [CartoonMe](http://www.cartoonme.com/en/), and for $5.69 you can have one too.

Here is a pic of my mug before becoming a cartoon:

And here is me after [CartoonMe](http://www.cartoonme.com/en/) got done with it:

I think I look better as a cartoon than I do in real life but now have a cool Twitter icon for a while.
