Well, today is a big day for Microsoft developers, [Visual Studio 2008 and the .NET Framework 3.5 has shipped](https://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-and-net-framework-3-5-shipped.aspx). This is great news and should lead to other releases I am personally waiting for, including the ASP.NET MVC Framework.

Chris Bowen talks about the [Visual Studio 2008 Training Kit on his blog](https://blogs.msdn.com/cbowen/archive/2007/11/19/visual-studio-2008-and-training-kit-released.aspx) and gives a link to getting it. This kit looks to be some really nice training for LINQ and C# 3.0. I am downloading now....

I guess most of us need to download VS 2008 from MSDN downloads as that is the way to get it right now.
