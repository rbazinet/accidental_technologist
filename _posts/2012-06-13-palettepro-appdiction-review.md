Since the launch of our first company-owned iOS application, [PalettePro](https://blog.stillriversoftware.com/2012/05/29/palette-pro-available-in-the-apple-app-store/), ?at the end of May, it has been a bit of a learning experience about marketing my first application and every bit of publicity helps and is appreciated.

I was pleased to see the [write-up about PalettePro on the AppDictions web site](https://appdictions.com/palettepro-app-review/). ?

> The concept of this tool is simple?the best ones usually are. Sometimes people spot a color that they would have for a project or practical purposes. What you can do with PalettePro is take a picture with your gadget from within the application, select the color from the image and allow the app to isolate the exact hue you wanted. It couldn?t be any simpler or more straight-forward; this is a tool that even the most technologically-impaired person could get the hang of it after a few tries.

The idea of PalettePro is simplicity and it pleases me it's one thing that stood out.
