Since receiving my Dell Mini back in September I have found some nice resources pop-up over the past couple months that have been updated on a regular basis and have good community support. I just wanted to share these for folks who may not be aware of them.

### Ubuntu on the Dell Mini 9

This blog goes into some nice detail how to install and maintain Ubuntu Linux on the Mini. The site also explains how to support various applications on Ubuntu to optimize them for the Mini form factor.

### My Dell Mini

This site has a lot of very specific add-ons and products for the Dell Mini. If you are looking for the latest SSD drives, memory upgrades, etc. for the Mini, this site has it.

There are also very active forums on the site too which answers questions you may not find elsewhere.

### Dell Inspiron Mini 9 Mods

This is a set of forums for the Mini which have just gotten started. The focus, obvious from the title, is about modding the Mini 9.

### Dell Ideastorm

This web site is from Dell and allows you to put in suggestions to improve the Dell Mini, complaints about the current Mini and you will see how others feel about the idea. You will see comments about the ideas and possible existing solutions.

### Dell Linux Support Wiki

Nice wiki created by Dell covering all of their support options for Linux (primarily Ubuntu) on their computers. There are links to their support forums for Ubuntu on this site.

Please let me know if there are other resources I am not aware of. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list, just ones I have stumbled upon when I was setting up Ubuntu 8.10 on my Dell Mini 9.
