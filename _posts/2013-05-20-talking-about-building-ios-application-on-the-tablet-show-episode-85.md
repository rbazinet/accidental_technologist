[I was a guest recently on The Tablet Show](https://www.thetabletshow.com/default.aspx?showNum=85) with Richard Campbell and Carl Franklin, to talk about iOS development, client projects, API's with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and creating applications with interactive back ends.

I think it turned out pretty well but I really can't stand listening to my own voice, so please give it a listen and decide for your self.

Thanks to Richard and Carl for having me on the show.
