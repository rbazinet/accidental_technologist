Unless you are living under a rock you are probably aware that [Microsoft released Visual Studio 2005 today in conjunction with SQL Server 2005 and Biztalk Server 2006](https://www.microsoft.com/windowsserversystem/applicationplatform/launch2005/default.mspx). This is a release that has been a long time coming and many of us .NET developers have been waiting for. I have been working with VS 2005 since pre-beta1 and it is huge improvement over VS 2003.

Also annouced today, [Microsoft will be giving away the Express Editions of VS 2005 for the period of one year](https://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/). These are the editions that will be low cost in the $80-$100 range.

It seems on the heels of this announcement that Microsoft has plans for a service pack for the VS2005 release as well as a much overdue one for VS2003. [The announcement was made by a Microsoft C# product manager](https://blogs.msdn.com/scottwil/archive/2005/11/07/490007.aspx), so it seem official.

Yet another release today from Microsoft is the [Web Services Enhancements 3.0](https://msdn.microsoft.com/webservices/webservices/building/wse/), which is the much anticipated add-on to VS2005 to help create secure web services under .NET 2.0.

There are probably some tidbits I missed, I will update if I hear about any additional releases of interest.
