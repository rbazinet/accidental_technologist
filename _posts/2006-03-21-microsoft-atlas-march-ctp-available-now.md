The latest and greatest CTP of Atlas is available now. You can check it out [here and download it](https://atlas.asp.net/Default.aspx?tabid=47). This CTP also includes the “Go Live” license so you can use this version in your applications and produce production code.

I have been using Atlas in some test projects and it appears Microsoft is producing some nice AJAX features we can use without having to be a JavaScript expert.

This announcement came from MIX’06 and you can find more information [here](https://www.nikhilk.net/Entry.aspx?id=112) as well.
