I hear of people who are looking for work, either as a full-time employee or a contractor, go through an extensive interview process, and if they are lucky enough to be offered a role, they cannot afford the salary. Iâ€™d like to see all companies looking to hire people to post the opening and have full-disclosure on the amount of money the candidate will receive if offered the job. I do see some companies offer a range but far too few do this. I think recruiters behave because they are reluctant to share too much information and lose a possible hire. Imagine going through the hiring process companies many companies use today; 3-5 weeks of multiple rounds of interviews, coding sessions, and onsite visits to learn the money offered was too low. It would be draining. When I talk to companies about possible projects, I get it the money topic out right away. This way, often the deciding factor, is out in the open.
