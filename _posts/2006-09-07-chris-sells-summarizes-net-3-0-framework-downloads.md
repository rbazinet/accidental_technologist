In the event you have been living under a rock, [Chris Sells' post](https://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=2042) summarizing the all of the available .NET 3.0 RC1 Framework downloads, gives the links to all the necessary tools to start working with the next release of the framework. I have been working with some of the new features in .NET for some time now and it looks great. The tools I am looking forward to is the new ADO.NET which include LINQ for Entities as well as the new features in C#. RC1 means we should see release bits soon.
