I just wanted to point out a great (in my opinion) panel discussion from TechEd about how to survive as a person with a technical job in today?s economy. From the TechEd site:

> Times are hard--we all know that. With companies laying people off left and right, this panel discusses specific ways to stay relevant, stay engaged, and frankly, stay employed during the economic downturn. From technologies to focus on, to focusing on quality practices, to managing the politics of the workplace, to networking, the panel discusses how developers can make sure they do all they can so that their careers are not casualties of the economic crisis.

The discussion is titled [Surviving the Downturn: A Panel Discussion](https://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail4096.html) and is from TechEd, but don?t let that deter you. This is not about Microsoft technology but about being a software engineer today, whether you are an employee, contractor, freelancer or self-employed creator of software.
