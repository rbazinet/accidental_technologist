[![Komodo.Jpg](https://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2006/02/Komodo.Jpg)](https://rbazinet.wordpress.com/?attachment_id=57 "Komodo.Jpg") In my continuing effort to find a decent Ruby IDE under Windows or Mac OSX I decided to try the Ruby IDE from ActiveState known as [Komodo](https://www.activestate.com/Products/Komodo/). This is an IDE geared toward dynamic languages such as Perl, PHP and Python. Only until recently has it supported Ruby. The install was a standard install but when first starting Komodo for the first time it asked me what language I was using, I chose [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). It appeared to be searching my Ruby install directory for libraries. After about 5 minutes it was done and the IDE was ready for a test. I created a blank Ruby file and started typing which to my surprise and amazement when typing a Ruby language construct like "Time" and following it with a "." it gave me a list of methods and properties of Time. This is the basic type of feature I am looking for. I would expect all relevant IDE's to be able to give me this basic bit of information. It would be nice to be able to put the [Rails](https://www.rubyonrails.org) libraries into the IDE's dictionary as well. Maybe I am asking too much. Is this possible in Komodo? I have a support call into Komodo to find out.? I will post an update here. Komodo does support Rails debugging but have not tried this feature yet. I plan to give Komodo a solid test very soon in conjuction with my testing of [RadRails](https://www.radrails.org) and future tests on the TextMate, which many Rails developers use. I want to see what the big fuss is all about. All-in-all Komodo looks to be the most mature Ruby IDE I have tested so far.? I am looking forward to finding out more.
