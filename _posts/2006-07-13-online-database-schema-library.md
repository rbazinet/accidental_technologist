I came across this [Library of Free Database Models](http://www.databaseanswers.org/data%5Fmodels/) from [Scott Guthrie?s blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/07/12/Tip_2F00_Trick_3A00_-Online-Database-Schema-Samples-Library.aspx) recently.? Below is an example of one design I did in the past months this source would have been extremely helpful. If you are starting a new project of expanding one this resource should prove to be a great place to start when thinking about your schema design. ?![customers_campaigns_ecommerce_dezign.gif](http://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2006/07/customers_campaigns_ecommerce_dezign.gif) Technorati Tags : [SQL Server 2005](http://technorati.com/tag/SQL%20Server%202005), [Database Design](http://technorati.com/tag/Database%20Design)
