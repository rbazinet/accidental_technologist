Microsoft has made available a really nice set of extended controls for use with Atlas. The announcement was made by [Shawn Burke](http://blogs.msdn.com/sburke/archive/2006/04/12/575373.aspx), who is on the Atlas team. The toolkit is available form the Atlas site, [here](http://atlas.asp.net/default.aspx?tabid=47&subtabid=477). The toolkit is really a set of samples that show controls and extenders for the existing Atlas controls. There is also an SDK that assists developers to create their own controls and extenders. The controls out-of-the-box are pretty nice. My favorite is the Drag Panel which behaves much like the panels on my.yahoo.com. If you donâ€™t have Atlas which I mentioned the release [here](http://rbazinet.wordpress.com/2006/04/11/microsoft-atlas-april-ctp-released/), then [go get it](http://atlas.asp.net/default.aspx?tabid=47&subtabid=471). From the Atlas toolkit web site you can check out the samples included in the toolkit:

 I am planning on digging into these controls over the next week or so and I will report back on them. Technorati Tags: [ASP.NET](http://technorati.com/tag/ASP.NET), [Ajax](http://technorati.com/tag/Ajax), [Atlas](http://technorati.com/tag/Atlas), [Microsoft](http://technorati.com/tag/Microsoft)
