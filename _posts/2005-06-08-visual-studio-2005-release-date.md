In case you haven't heard, Microsoft announced at Tech'Ed 2005 that Visual Studio will be released Nov. 7th 2005. This will be a milestone in .NET development. Microsoft is known for doing things right in release 3 of any product and this is our 3rd release of Visual Studio .NET.

Microsoft is issuing "go-live" licenses for VS2005 from it's beta 2 product that became available a short time ago. If you sign the End-User License Agreement (EULA) you can take advantage of this.

In my company we are creating applications today using VS2005 Beta 2 and plan to use those in a live environment before the actual release of the product.
