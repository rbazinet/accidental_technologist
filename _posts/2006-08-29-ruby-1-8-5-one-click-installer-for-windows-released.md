Curt Hibbs has released the latest in his [One-Click installer for Windows](http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=167). This release includes the newest Ruby, 1.8.5. This is a great way for anyone wanting to run Ruby under windows to get the latest build of Ruby and install it like we expect all of our applications to install under Windows. Curt is also the person responsible for the great [RubyForge](http://rubyforge.org) project known as [InstantRails](http://rubyforge.org/projects/instantrails/), which gives Windows developers a complete [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org) development environment including; Ruby, Ruby on Rails, MySQL and Apache all in one package with little configuration. This is well worth getting if you run Windows and want to run Rails without the hassle of configuration.
