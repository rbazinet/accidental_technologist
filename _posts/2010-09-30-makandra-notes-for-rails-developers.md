The Ruby Rails consulting shop [Makandra](http://makandra.com/) recently opened their [internal knowledge base](http://makandra.com/notes/) of how-tos and code snippets for all to see and use. [The announcement about the project indicates 500+ links](http://gem-session.com/2010/09/in-which-we-open-source-our-knowledge-base):

> This September we decided to take our in-house knowledge base and publish it for everyone to see. [makandra notes](http://makandra.com/notes/) contains some 200 HOWTOs and 500+ links for Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Cucumber and Javascript and is growing every day.

The reality is as of this writing, 718 notes are listed. It?s a good resource and one I hope they add to and either let others contribute to or open source the application for others to use to build internal/external knowledge bases.

The search is fast too and real-time, narrowing down results as I typed.

Besides having some useful information you can also see the user interface is nice and clean. The resource is from a Rails shop but it is not just for Rails issues but rather the issues Rails developers deal with each day, from Ruby, Rails and JavaScript to Ubuntu server administration and cron jobs.

Way to go Makandra and thanks for the resource.
