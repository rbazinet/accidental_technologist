I realized that I have neglected my blog for a very long time. I wanted to write up something so that any readers I had left didn’t think I had simply stopped existing.

What to write about?

Is writing about Ruby on Rails and how to do this or that even relevant any long? Does anyone still look to blogs for solutions to problems we might be facing? I don’t know. I solve problems this way though but maybe I am the rare case.

Is it time I start writing more about the entrepreneurial side of what I enjoy doing? I’m not sure.

I am here and still existing.
