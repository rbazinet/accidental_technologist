I have to admit, I have a problem. I am addicted to podcasts and I listen to them all, either on a commute to a client or while working. I stumbled across a new one (to me) recently and I wanted to share it with my readers. [![ThirstyDeveloper_small](http://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/thirstydeveloper-small-thumb.png)](http://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/thirstydeveloper-small.png)

It's called [The Thirsty Developer](http://thirstydeveloper.com/) and it covers development from a fairly platform agnostic view. Recent shows cover topics such as:

- Scrum
- Collaboration between Developers and Designers
- Continuous Integration
- Globalization and Localization

They do cover such specific topics such as:

- Silverlight 2
- IIS

As I write this there are 16 episodes and just need to check out the [podcast feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ThirstyDeveloperPodcast) to see all the episode details. The sound quality on many podcasts, especially new ones varies a lot but they seem to have gotten it right. The sound quality is excellent and the conversations good too.
