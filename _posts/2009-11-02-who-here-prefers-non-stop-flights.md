I wonder who designed the user experience at [Orbitz](http://www.orbitz.com/)? I cannot imagine the design meeting which resulted with this checkbox on their flight search page:

[![Orbitz](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/WhoHerePrefersNonStopFlights_CAE2/Orbitz_thumb.png "Orbitz")](https://accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/WhoHerePrefersNonStopFlights_CAE2/Orbitz_2.png)

Does anyone look at that checkbox and decide they don?t want a non-stop flight? No, I would love for this flight to take as long as humanly possible.

I find it humorous every time I search for flights at Orbitz. At least have the box checked by default so I don?t have to. Maybe as a web developer I notice things like this that most would not and I think about it too much but I wanted to share.
