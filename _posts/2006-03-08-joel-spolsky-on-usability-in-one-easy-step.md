I don’t like to post a link to someone else’s blog or web site without having a good reason. Joel Spolsky of [FogCreek Software](http://www.fogcreek.com/) and the popular [Joel on Software](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) web site recently [posted about usability](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/design/1stDraft/03.html). His post goes hand-in-hand with my post about product complexity from [yesterday](http://rbazinet.wordpress.com/2006/03/07/complexity-causes-50-of-product-returns/).

Joel has a book out on user interface design and his company's software, FogBugz, has a beautiful user interface that is truly “usable”. I think his post is worth a read.
