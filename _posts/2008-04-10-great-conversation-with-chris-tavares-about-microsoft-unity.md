I had a really great conversation recently with [Chris Tavares](https://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/), the lead developer of the [Unity Application Block](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc468366.aspx) for Microsoft. The chat was for my weekly article on InfoQ. Please [check it out](https://www.infoq.com/news/2008/04/microsoft-unity).

Some information on Unity to get going:

- [Introduction to Unity](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc440954.aspx)
- [Downloading Unity](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=6A9E363C-8E0A-48D3-BBE4-C2F36423E2DF&displaylang=en)
- [Unity and Silverlight](https://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/post/Unity-and-Silverlight-It-can-be-done!.aspx)
- [Using Unity and the ASP.NET MVC Preview 2](https://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/post/Using-Unity-and-the-ASPNET-MVC-Preview-2.aspx)

There are certainly a good number of Dependency Injection contains for .NET which have either been around for a long time or have sprung up recently. I am planning a post covering them in a bit of detail for those interested in learning about DI containers or understanding what is available.
