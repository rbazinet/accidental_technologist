[Thom Robbins](http://blogs.msdn.com/trobbins/default.aspx) is our local Microsoft guy here in New England and he organize the Code Camps for us. He [just announced](http://blogs.msdn.com/trobbins/archive/2006/03/08/546180.aspx) [Code Camp 5 : Code Frenzy](http://www.thomscontent.com/codecamp5/) is open for business or registration and call for speakers, that is.

I attended Code Camp 4 and had a great time learning some new things, networking and relaxing on a weekend. The cost is free, the only catch is you have to use up a weekend but this is a great way to spend it.

The sessions are intense and the days are long but you will walk out with some knowledge and maybe a new friend or two.
