[Dan Fernandez](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2005/10/27/485863.aspx) pointed out in his blog about a tool from Microsoft to do an Automatic Uninstall of the pre-RTM bits of VS2005. It's unsupported but will probably be better than going through the mound of steps required to perform before doing other VS2005 updates.

Also released today on the MSDN site is RTM versions of SQL Server 2005 and the .NET 2.0 Runtime.

I noted earlier I had tried to get to the MSDN site and had no luck downloading VS2005. I noticed in my first try the only downloads available were ISO of CD's but returning to the site later should DVD ISO's instead, which I was able to download on the first try. 3.6G but on my 4MB cable connection it didn't take long.

I noticed while on the MSDN site that there are several flavors of VS2005 available:

- Visual Studio 2005 Standard
- Visual Studio 2005 Professional
- Visual Studio 2005 Team System for Software Developers
