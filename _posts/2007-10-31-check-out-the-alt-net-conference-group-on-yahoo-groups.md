I am sure most .NET developers have heard of the ALT.NET Conference whose name was coined by [David Laribee](https://laribee.com/blog/2007/04/10/altnet/) and was hosted in Austin, TX on October 5-7, 2007.

Well, it seem the movement has some traction and those involved have started a group in [Yahoo Groups](https://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/altnetconf/), it's well worth checking out. There are 1870 messages posted for October alone, as I write this. The discussions are great and include all types of topics of interest to .NET developers today.

Here is a description of the group to pique your interest:

> Spawned from the AltNetConf in Austin, TX in October, 2007. We are .Net developers looking striving to create quality software on the .Net platform.
> 
>   
> [ALT.NET](https://altdotnet.org/) - You?re the type of developer who uses what works while keeping an eye out for a better way. - You reach outside the mainstream to adopt the best of any community: Open Source, Agile, Java, Ruby, etc. - You?re not content with the status quo. Things can always be better expressed, more elegant and simple, more mutable, higher quality, etc. - You know tools are great, but they only take you so far. It?s the principles and knowledge that really matter. The best tools are those that embed the knowledge and encourage the principles
