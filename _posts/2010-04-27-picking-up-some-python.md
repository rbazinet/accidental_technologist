I have been using Ruby and various .NET languages for a long-time but the coming flood of deep architecture changes coming to Ruby on Rails 3.0 has drawn my attention to other web frameworks such as [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) and the [Python language](http://python.org/).

The attention everyone gives to Ruby on Rails has resulted in a wealth of Ruby and Ruby on Rails books to the point of becoming overwhelming. This is not the case with Python and Django, the number of books is a lot less.

[Zed Shaw](http://sheddingbikes.com/) is one developer who made the transition from Ruby to Python and is putting out a learning Python book of his own titled [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://sheddingbikes.com/LearnPythonTheHardWay.pdf). The book is being made [available on Zed?s web site](http://sheddingbikes.com/posts/1272132621.html) and is free.

Zed also [points out some other great resources for learning Python](http://sheddingbikes.com/posts/1272216358.html):

> I really quickly wanted to get the word out about two books that are so far looking to be great beginner Python books.
> 
> 1. [How To Think Like A Computer Scientist](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/) is actually used as the curriculum at a few universities in the US and maybe in other locations. Despite the title it is actually good introduction to the language and to programming.
> 2. [A Byte Of Python](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python) is also free and has been translated to \[a huge number of languages\](http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python\_en:Translations and also seems to a good first book.

This is really interesting approach to writing a book; collaborative and open. There is a [wiki set up to help facilitate the collaboration](http://learnpythonthehardway.com/home).

Python is a great language with rich history and wealth of good libraries. It?s used heavily all over the world and has deep community support, well worth a look and considering how good Django is for web applications. Who knows maybe worth a look instead of Ruby on Rails.
