 I just [read about Google releasing an update](http://scobleizer.com/2007/12/04/google-is-taking-over-the-mobile-world/) to it's applications for mobile, with explicit updates for the iPhone. I am running on the AT &amp; T Edge network which has been criticized for being slow, and all I can say about this update is WOW, it is wicked fast.

I use my iPhone to do some Google searches but also to access my GMail account as well as Google Reader. It switches applications very fast and updates them nicely as well. I am very happy with this update, great job Google.

I found a more [detailed review](http://www.parislemon.com/2007/12/google-unifies-and-tidies-up-its-iphone.html) of the new features along with a [nice write-up from TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/04/google-pre-launches-new-iphone-interface/). I plan to spend a lot more time with it but as far as I am concerned, this update is the best yet.

Google, now make the new Google Maps location feature work on my iPhone...please!
