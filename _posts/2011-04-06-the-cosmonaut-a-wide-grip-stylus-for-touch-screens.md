Since buying the first iPad a year ago I have looked for and tried many a stylus. ?I have found myself disappointed in all of them. I came across a [Kickstarter project named The Cosmonaut](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/danprovost/the-cosmonaut-a-wide-grip-stylus-for-touch-screens) which looks like a big crayon to me and conceived by the same people who created [The Glif](https://theglif.com/). The inspiration for the design from the site:

> The Cosmonaut was born out of our desire to have a really great stylus for our iPads. We love to sketch out quick ideas or doodle on our tablets, and using a stylus is much better than a finger for such tasks. We bought several different models currently available on the market but they all suffered the same problem: they were designed to look and feel like a pen. But why? Writing or drawing on the iPad feels nothing like using a pen or pencil. For one, tablets are ideal for low fidelity sketching. Also, it is pretty awkward to rest your palm on the screen of the device because it throws off the capacitive detection. Writing on a tablet feels like writing on a dry erase board: fast, simple, low fidelity. The perfect tablet stylus is one that feels like a dry erase marker.

 I am sure to blog about this stylus when it ships in June.
