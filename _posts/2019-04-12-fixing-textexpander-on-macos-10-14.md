I use [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/?_ga=2.123764618.1471471561.1555080720-1441338867.1555080720) from [Smile Software](https://smilesoftware.com/) every day and rely on it for so many helpful snippets. After upgrading my iMac to macOS Mojave, I realized that TextExpander was broken and nothing I tried worked. It seems TextExpander would no longer expand any snippets. Trying the menu option to “Enable Expansion” did nothing. I sent a support request to Smile and was really happy to have a response in the matter of an hour. Not surprising, I was not the only one with the issue:

> Hi Rob, Thank you for contacting Smile Support. I’m sorry to hear that you’re having trouble. A few users have reported something similar and these instructions should get it working again: <https://smilesoftware.com/blog/entry/textexpander-macos-10-14-mojave-and-accessibility> After you complete those steps it may also be necessary to click on the TextExpander icon in the menu bar and choose 'Enable Expansion'. Please let me know if you continue to have trouble.

 Maybe this will help someone else with the same problem.
