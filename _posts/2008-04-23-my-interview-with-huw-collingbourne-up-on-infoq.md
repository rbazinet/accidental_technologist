I have been a happy Ruby in Steel user for quite a while now and have built a bit of a rapport with Huw Collingbourne, co-founder of [SapphireSteel Software](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/), the developers of Ruby in Steel.[![huw1](http://www.accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/MyInterviewwithHuwCollingbourneuponInfoQ_734C/huw1_thumb.jpg)](http://www.accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/MyInterviewwithHuwCollingbourneuponInfoQ_734C/huw1_2.jpg)

On Monday, [SapphireSteel Software released a new version of Ruby in Steel, version 1.2](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/Ruby-In-Steel-1-2-Launched). This version includes a new Visual Rails Workbench that allows developers to create Ruby on Rails applications visually as Visual Studio developers have come to expect.

From the Ruby in Steel web site:

> The principal features of the Visual Rails Workbench are:
> 
> ![-](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/dist/puce.gif) Full page editing of complete web pages (composites of Rails layouts/views/partials)   
> ![-](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/dist/puce.gif) Drag and Drop design - add controls from a toolbox   
> ![-](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/dist/puce.gif) Set properties using the Property panel   
> ![-](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/dist/puce.gif) Resize and move controls using mouse or keyboard

> ![-](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/dist/puce.gif) Edit code as ERb/RHTML or as HTML   
> ![-](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/dist/puce.gif) Document Navigator navigates document structure (HTML)/or methods (ERB/Ruby)   
> ![-](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/dist/puce.gif) Quick navigation between controller and view

In addition to all its existing capabilities (such as breakpoints, watch variables, call stack navigation, step into/out/over, locals, autos, drill-down debugging and debugging into ERb/RHTML templates)
> 
> Ruby In Steel 1.2 adds the following debugging features:
> 
> - Tracepoints
> - Conditional breakpoints
> - Break on hitcount
> - Run macro on break
> - Break on exception

I had the opportunity to chat with Huw about Visual Rails Workbench for the [interview which can be read at InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/04/visual-rails-workbench).
