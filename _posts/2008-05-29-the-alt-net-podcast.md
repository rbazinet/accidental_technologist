[Mike Moore](http://blowmage.com/) has a new podcast out called the [ALT.NET Podcast](http://altnetpodcast.com/) where he talks with the people following the [ALT.NET community](http://altdotnet.org/). I have listened to the first two episodes and think both are really good and deserve a listen. Mike is the creator of the [Rubiverse podcast](http://rubiverse.com/) as well.

I recently had the opportunity to [talk with Mike about the podcast for my work on InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/05/altnet-podcast). Mike has some great plans for the podcast and if you follow the ALT.NET community then give it a listen.

The term [ALT.NET](http://altdotnet.org/) seems to have gained a lot of traction of the past year or so since [David Laribee](http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/) came up with the name and has hosted a couple "unconference" ALT.NET conferences so far along with Scott Bellware.
