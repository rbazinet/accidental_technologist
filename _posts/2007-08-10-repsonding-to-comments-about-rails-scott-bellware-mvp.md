There has been some really good discussions going on in the blog world about the Rails vs. .NET debate (MonoRail in particular), if you want to call it that.

I posted recently [here](https://rbazinet.wordpress.com/2007/08/01/why-not-just-use-ruby-on-rails/) about the subject from reasoning in my own mind and to foster the discussion on my blog.

[Scott Bellware](https://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/default.aspx) has had a series of blog posts on the subject and [today posted](https://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/archive/2007/08/10/166637.aspx) with his comments about recent comments. I think the debate is very healthy and shows the passion from both sides. What is particularly interesting to me is Scott is a Microsoft MVP, so he has an investment in Microsoft technologies but is very passionate about Ruby and Rails.

Scott has a [previous post](https://codebetter.com/blogs/scott.bellware/archive/2007/08/07/166539.aspx) talking about MonoRail vs. Rails which is also worth the time to read.

The comments posted are also worth reading, all very good.
