I have been using [Twhirl](https://twhirl.org/) as my [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) client of choice on Windows for a few weeks now and am really happy with, especially when Twitter is actually up and running.

Twhirl is based on the [Adobe AIR platform](https://www.adobe.com/products/air) and puts a nice rich client on the Twitter experience. The nice thing is, it also runs in Apple Macs too.

The new release also allows cross-posting updates to [Pownce](https://pownce.com) and [Jaiku](https://www.jaiku.com/) too. I would like to be able to read updates on Pownce and Jaiku from Twhirl, but we will see if developers respond and give us a client capable of this. Other features include:

> Some of twhirl?s features:
> 
> - runs on both Windows (XP/Vista) and Mac OSX
> - automatically fetches your friends? status updates, as well as replies and direct messages for you, into an all-in-one timeline
> - color-coding different types of messages
> - connecting to multiple Twitter accounts
> - keyboard shortcuts
> - sys tray / dock icon support
> - visual and audible notifications on new tweets, configurable and with preview
> - view, add and remove favorites
> - shorten long URLs (using snurl.com)
> - automatically checking for twhirl updates
> - changeable color schemes
> - search public tweets (powered by [terraminds](https://terraminds.com/twitter))
> - **NEW:** timeline filtering
> - **NEW:** localization (English, German, Italian, Spanish)
> - **NEW:** network status indicator
> - **NEW:** cross-post to Pownce and Jaiku
> - **NEW:** marks new tweets as unseen

The support has also been very good. I hope this clients goes a long way.
