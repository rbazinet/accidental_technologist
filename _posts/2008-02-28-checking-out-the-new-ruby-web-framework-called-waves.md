I recently had the pleasure to interview [Dan Yoder](https://rubywaves.com/blog/hang-ten), the creator of a new [Ruby web framework called Waves](https://rubywaves.com/). Waves is a MVC framework, like that of [Ruby on Rails](https://www.rubyonrails.org) but takes on some very unique ways of doing things and it piqued my interest. I missed Waves when I wrote about [10 Alternative Ruby Web Frameworks](https://rbazinet.wordpress.com/2008/01/14/10-alternative-ruby-web-frameworks/) recently and Dan pinged me to let me know about Waves.

Dan has leveraged existing technology were appropriate, such as:

- [Markaby](https://markaby.rubyforge.org/)
- [Erubis](https://www.kuwata-lab.com/erubis/)
- [Sequel](https://sequel.rubyforge.org/)
- [Mongrel](https://mongrel.rubyforge.org/)
- [Rack](https://rack.rubyforge.org/)

It's great to see web frameworks being created for Ruby, a perfect example that the success of Rails continues to drive innovation.

You can read my [interview with Dan on InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/news/2008/02/waves-ruby-framework) and checkout the [Waves feature list](https://rubywaves.com/features) on the Waves web site.
