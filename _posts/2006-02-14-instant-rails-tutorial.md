[![InstantRails](https://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2006/02/InstantRails.Jpg)](https://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2006/02/InstantRails.Jpg "InstantRails") I found [this great tutorial](https://instantrails.rubyforge.org/tutorial/index.html "Instant Rails Tutorial") on getting started with [Instant Rails](https://instantrails.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl "Instant Rails"). I used this tutorial to get started. It is a great summary of all the parts and pieces tossed into Instant Rails, what they are and how to know your way around them. I highly recommend this as a great place to start. Technorati Tags: [Ruby on Rails](https://www.technorati.com/tags/Ruby%20on%20Rails), [Instant Rails](https://www.technorati.com/tags/Instant%20Rails)
