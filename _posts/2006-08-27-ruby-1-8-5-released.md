I received the following email from the Ruby list:

> *Hello,* *We have just released the latest stable version of Ruby. This is a bug fix release. There should be no big difference from 1.8.4. We hope 1.8.5 is more stable and reliable than its preceding versions.* *<ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ruby-1.8.5.tar.gz> 3fbb02294a8ca33d4684055adba5ed6f*   *Happy Hacking!* *matz.*

 I don't see the download on the Ruby site but the link to the ftp site works fine. It appears to be some bug fixes but do address some stability issues. Technorati Tags: [Ruby](https://technorati.com/tag/Ruby)
