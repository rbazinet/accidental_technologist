So, I recently learned about a local Ruby and Rails conference coming in a couple weeks to within driving distance to me, [Ruby East 2007](http://www.ruby-east.com/rubyeast/index.php). It will be on September 28, 2007 at the Penn State, Great Valley Campus.

The [speaker lineup](http://www.ruby-east.com/rubyeast/speakers.php) looks good as does the [agenda](http://www.ruby-east.com/rubyeast/agenda.php). As a bonus the winners of the [RailsRumble](http://www.railsrumble.com/) will be announced at this event.

So, who is going to attend?
