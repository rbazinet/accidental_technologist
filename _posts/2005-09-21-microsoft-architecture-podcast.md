Microsoft seems to be focusing more on architecture these days. There is a new [podcast](https://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=share.podcast&abver=E9A00024-3DC1-4B6A-BC20-22716E4D2FEA) available on the [Microsoft Architecture](https://www.microsoft.com/architecture/default.aspx?pid=share.welcome&abver=E9A00024-3DC1-4B6A-BC20-22716E4D2FEA) site. The site has some great content and have also created a [blog](https://www.microsoft.com/architecture/aggregate.aspx?pid=share.read&abver=) too.
