I have been running the Google Chrome browser since it came out last week and I am pleasantly surprised how happy I am with it. I am normally an early-adopter and decide quickly how much I like something and dump it fast. So far so good.

One interesting thing I noticed yesterday was the version number of Chrome:

Notice the version is 0.2.149.27 and the Official Build is 1583. Today I looked at the same About Google Chrome dialog and now see this:

The version is now 0.2.149.29 and the Official Build is 1798. What is interesting about this is I was never asked me if I wanted a new version, Google just assumed I wanted it. I have gone through the dialogs and I cannot find a place where I can request to be asked before a new upgrade is installed.

I assume I would want the latest updates, but what if I don't? Is this OK or is Google assuming too much control?
