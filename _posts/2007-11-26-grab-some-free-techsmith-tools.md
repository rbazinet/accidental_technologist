I use [SnagIt](http://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.asp) from [Techsmith](http://www.techsmith.com/) on a regular basis for creating screen shots for some of the posts I publish here as well as for some writing on do for InfoQ or even some training work I perform. I came across some free versions of both [SnagIt](http://www.techsmith.com/screen-capture.asp) and [Camtasia Studio](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp) (screen casting tool).

These tools are not the latest versions but appear to be eligible as upgrades to the latest versions.

You can download and get a license for [Snagit here](http://www.labnol.org/software/download/free-download-snagit-with-serial-number/1841/) and for [Camtasia Studio here](http://www.labnol.org/software/download/download-camtasia-studio-free/1829/). Enjoy, both are great tools.
