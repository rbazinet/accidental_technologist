Just a quick note: I recently purchased the [Rails Rescue Handbook](http://www.railsrescuebook.com/) by [Mike Gunderloy](http://afreshcup.com/) from his web site. The book gives a lot of great tips and best approaches to taking on a Rails project that may not be up-to-par.

I think the book addresses many of the areas we face as Rails consultants on daily basis and should guide us in our own coding efforts and reviewing and refactoring the code of others.

Mike talked with me about the book in an interview for [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/07/rails-rescue-handbook) to give folks a better understanding of where problems and bad code can occur and what to do about it.

Please take the time to check out the interview - [Rescuing Your Ruby on Rails Projects](http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/07/rails-rescue-handbook).
