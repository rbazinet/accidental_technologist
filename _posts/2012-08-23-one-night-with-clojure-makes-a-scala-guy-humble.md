Really interesting take on using [Clojure?from a long-time Scala developer over on DZone](https://agile.dzone.com/news/one-night-clojure-makes-scala)

The lines of code (LOC) metric is the most interesting to me:

> A simple metric generated with cloc, namely Lines of Code really blew me away about Clojure:

> - Java version: 755 lines of code (LOC)

> <div>Yup, that?s right, the Clojure version is more than 10 times less code, and about 7-8 times less than it?s Scala equivalent. In fairness though, the Scala number is a bit misleading: it was written before I got really familiar with Scala, and could probably be condensed to about 150-200 LOC?s. But still, it seems Clojure has a 3-4x advantage on even Scala.</div>

As someone who has been dabbling with Clojure, mainly to learn some functional programming and see what all the hype is about, these details are really interesting and compelling. ?It may be time for me to convert part of an application to Clojure and experience for myself.
