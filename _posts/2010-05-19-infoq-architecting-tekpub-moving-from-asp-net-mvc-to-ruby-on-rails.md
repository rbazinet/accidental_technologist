**UPDATE:** Rob Conery posted a [great overview of using MongoDB at Tekpub](http://blog.wekeroad.com/2010/05/19/no-sql-in-the-wild). The InfoQ post also stirred up some [discussion on Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1362169).

I had the opportunity over the past week to talk with [Rob Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/) (ex-Microsoft) and [James Avery](http://averyblog.com/) about [TekPub](http://tekpub.com/), one my favorite training sites on the web, for a detailed case study for InfoQ.

The interview was particularly interesting as it covers Tekpub moving from ASP.NET MVC to Ruby on Rails and ASP.NET MVC is the subject of a [book Rob Conery co-authored](http://www.amazon.com/Professional-ASP-NET-MVC-Wrox-Programmer/dp/0470384611/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1274236324&sr=8-2). This says a lot about the position Microsoft puts small companies in when trying to build a product. It also says a lot about the advantages open source gives to these small companies.

As often is the case, cost is a big factor. Please give it a read. The interview is up now - [Architecting TekPub - Moving from ASP.NET MVC to Ruby on Rails](http://www.infoq.com/articles/architecting-tekpub).
