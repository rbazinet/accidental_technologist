[View my Flipboard Magazine.](https://flipboard.com/section/swift-development-bUsx5i)?

I have been collecting resources together for everything I come across on [Apple Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/). ?I add these to a new [Flipboard magazine called Swift Development](https://flipboard.com/section/swift-development-bUsx5i). ?If you come across interesting links you feel should be in the magazine, pass them along to <rbazinet@accidentaltechnologist.com>.
