I don't usually post about movies, mainly because most movies these days really suck and aren't worth the time to even say I saw one. ?I did take in the new [JOBS film with Ashton Kutcher](http://jobsthefilm.com/). ?I really enjoy the movie. ?It brought back a lot of memories of how the industry was back in the day and how it has evolved since then. ?It was truly an exciting time and I hate to admit, a far more exciting and exhilarating time than today. ?

I've heard a lot of criticism leading up to the movie, both about the content and Kutcher's portrayal of Steve so going into the movie my expectations were not very high. ?I have followed the creation of Apple, and many tech companies for that matter, since I got my first computer in the early 80's..so I'm very familiar with the storyline.?

I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. ?It was just over 2 hours and I found myself entranced by the film. ?I thought Kutcher did a great job of becoming Steve Jobs, from his facial mannerisms, the looks, personality (maybe a bit nicer) to his walk.

Watching the feedback this weekend I have heard much about how the story wasn't told accurately and various aspect exaggerated. ?The fact that it was meant to honor Steve and Apple as well as entertain, should be obvious it is not a documentary.

Apple fans should enjoy the movie and avoid the criticism. ?My daughter and I thoroughly enjoy the story and would/will see it again. ?It was a trip back in time when technology seem magical and revolutionary.
