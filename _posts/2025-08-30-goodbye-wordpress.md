I have been using WordPress for many years but I never loved it. Actually, I never liked it.

It has been a long time since my last post, almost 2 1/2 years ago. Where does the time go. So many life changes. So many things to talk about. and 

I am hoping it motivates me to start writing on a regular cadence. Writing is a great way to clear ones head, to work out thoughts and ideas. 

I'm looking forward it...

I moved over the posts I had under WordPress and have noticed some weird formatting and layout. Give me some time over the next couple weeks to fix up those conversion errors.
