I discovered a new series of interviews with entrepreneurs called Product + Support. It?s created by [Ian Landsman](http://ianlandsman.com/)?founder of [UserScape](http://userscape.com/). The first one is up with [Hiten Shah](http://productandsupport.com/hiten-shah/)?and it?s really good. The interviews talk about running a successful product business, which we can never get enough. The line up of future interviews looks fantastic as well. I think this series is worth checking out.
