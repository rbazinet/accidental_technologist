![Not lost](/assets/img/2017/09/not_lost-1.jpg "not_lost.jpg") I was out trail running with a friend this past weekend when we stopped because we had taken a wrong turn. We looked down and at the base of the tree we were standing next to, we saw this rock with a message written on it. It was funny because we were off course but also a nice reminder about life in general.
