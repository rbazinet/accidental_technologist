IronRuby is now on RubyForge for all to download and build, as reported by [John Lam on his blog](https://www.iunknown.com/2007/08/ironruby-on-rub.html):

> It's been nearly 6 weeks since our initial source code release at OSCON. So what's changed?
> 
> - Exception handling
> - Parallel assignment
> - Instance variables
> 
> Added some more library support:
> 
> - Comparable
> - Enumerable
> - Array
> - Hash
> - String (not quite complete yet)
> - Dir

This is exciting news and a good indicator things are progressing along nicely for the IronRuby team.

If you want to get the source you can follow along a [nice tutorial](https://rubydoes.net/2007/09/01/getting-ironruby-from-rubyforge/) by Aaron Junod over on [rubydoes.net](https://rubydoes.net/).

Now on to the building process....
