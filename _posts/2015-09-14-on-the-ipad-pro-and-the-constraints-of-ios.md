I was hoping we were going to hear some really special news about the new [iPad Pro](http://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/) from the recent [Apple event](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2015/). I hoped we were going see the iPad Pro running OS X and an?[Intel Skylake](http://blogs.intel.com/technology/2015/09/our-best-processor-ever/)?processor. Why? This would allow such a wide array of existing great applications. Applications like Xcode, Microsoft Office or the Adobe Creative Suite.

Justin Williams beat me to the punch with [his thoughts on the iPad Pro](https://carpeaqua.com/on-the-ipad-pro-and-the-constraints-of-ios/):

> In their current incarnations, I believe that Windows 10 is better suited to the Surface than iOS is to the iPad Pro.

Granted both Microsoft and Adobe demonstrated tools developed specifically for the iPad Pro and the [Apple Pencil](http://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/). It?s a clean slate and the invented-for-ipad-pro apps are very few. There are so few apps that even look good and even fewer designed for the iPad today.

> And we haven?t even started talking about the third-party ecosystem for the iPad. I can count the number of apps on my left hand that are thoughtfully designed for the iPad screen size. Most are, for lack of a better phrase, blown-up iPhone apps. Just this week, Twitter updated their iPad app to be exactly like the iPhone version but with a bit more padding on the edges to make up for the larger screen size. That?s fine for the iPad mini and mostly tolerable for the Air. On the iPad Pro? That?s approaching clown shoes territory.

I had dreams of using my iPad Pro with Xcode as Microsoft Surface Pro developers are fortunate enough to be able to do with Visual Studio. A truly portable, pro-level, device with powerful applications.

iOS may be a better choice of operating system than OS X here but iOS is the limiting factor. I doubt we will ever see Xcode running on an iPad Pro. Developers are one example of pro-users, that means we have to stick with our MacBooks for the time being.
