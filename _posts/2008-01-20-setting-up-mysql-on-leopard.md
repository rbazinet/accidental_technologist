I just upgraded my MacBook Pro from Tiger to Leopard this weekend. No, Tiger was working fine but I wanted to have the latest Mac OS like everyone else, so what the heck. The installation went very smooth thanks to a nice [blog post over at Redline Software](https://weblog.redlinesoftware.com/2008/1/5/migrating-from-mac-osx-tiger-to-leopard). I backed up using [SuperDuper](https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html) and booted off the backup to make sure it worked, and it did. I use my MacBook Pro to write Ruby on Rails applications and use both SQLite3 and MySQL. It appears as of this writing there is not a pre-packaged release of MySQL which is supported under Leopard. There appears to be some inconsistent behavior I didn't want to have to deal with. I found a great blog post from Hivelogic called [Installing MySQL on Mac OSX](https://hivelogic.com/articles/installing-mysql-on-mac-os-x/). This post was dead-on and saved me a ton of time and I hope this post will guide you to solving your problem.
