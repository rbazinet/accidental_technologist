I attended [RubyFringe](https://rubyfringe.com/) this year in Toronto and had the chance to interview a few people, one being [John Lam](https://www.iunknown.com/) of Microsoft, to talk about IronRuby, Microsoft and Open Source and the general direction of the project.

**Summary of Talk:**

> In this interview from RubyFringe, John Lam talks about his work on IronRuby and how Microsoft is approaching Open Source software development.

You can find the [interview on the InfoQ web site](https://www.infoq.com/interviews/lam-ironruby-ms-opensource) and is about 1/2 hour in length.
