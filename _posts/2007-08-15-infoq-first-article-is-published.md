I was contacted recently to write some articles or news releases for [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com) in the .NET and Architecture areas. I was honored to be asked to contribute to a site I find particularly useful.

I wrote about my thoughts on InfoQ in the [past](https://rbazinet.wordpress.com/2007/07/20/infoq-great-source-for-developer-information/). I find their content focused and always relevant.

My first article is up on InfoQ, titled Promesh[.NET - an MVC Web Framework for .NET](https://www.infoq.com/news/2007/08/promesh). It is a conversation I had with [Philippe Leybaert](https://www.blog.activa.be/) the creator of [ProMesh.NET](https://www.codeplex.com/ProMesh), an MVC framework to create web applications on .NET. It talks about the recently released ProMesh.NET into open source on [CodePlex](https://www.codeplex.com/ProMesh). Please check it out.
