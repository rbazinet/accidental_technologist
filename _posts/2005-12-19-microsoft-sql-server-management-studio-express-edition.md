The recent release of Visual Studio 2005 came with it the express edition of SQL Server 2005. This is a trimmed down version of the full SQL Server 2005 we have all been waiting for but it's included in the box.

One of the main drawbacks to the Express Edition is the lack of a tool we are all used like Enterprise Manager from SQL 2000. Sure, you can use Server Explorer in VS 2005 and do some management of stored procedures, views and such but not the management we are all used to.

Enter [Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio Express Edition](https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=82afbd59-57a4-455e-a2d6-1d4c98d40f6e&displaylang=en), which provides a graphical management tool for SQL Server Express databases, with a bonus, you can also manage SQL Server 2005 databases as well.

Below you can see a screen shot of the main window. What a great tool, and it's free. After using it for a few days I can say the interface is so much more enjoyable than the old SQL Server 2000 Enterprise Manager I have been using for the last few years.
