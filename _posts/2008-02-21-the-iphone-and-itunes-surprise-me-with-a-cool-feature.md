[![itunes](http://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/itunes-thumb.jpg)](http://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/itunes.jpg)I have been using an [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) for about 5 months now and love the thing, it is the single greatest gadget I have ever bought. One reason I bought it was to replace my aging iPod Mini. I listen to as many podcasts as I can on my commute to client sites but also listen to the same podcasts on my PC when I am working at home.

One feature of [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/) and the iPhone I totally stumbled upon is one of its syncing features; When I am home listening to a podcast and then take to the road I always sync my iPhone so I have the latest podcasts from my subscriptions. I get in my car and finish the podcast I was listening to in my home office and viola...it starts in the **same place** I left off. How cool is this?? Sure, it's a small thing but it's one feature that makes me glad I own an iPhone. Topping it all off is when I come back home and sync the iPhone again, it updates the spot in the podcast I left off at in my car. Two-way book marking, very cool indeed.

My old iPod did not do this, but either the iPhone or the latest iTunes has added this great little feature.
