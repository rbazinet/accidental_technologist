I have pointed out in the past various tools I use for .NET development as they are upgraded and such. Instead of individual posts about each tool and filling up everyone's feed reader unnecessarily, I figured I would just group the new releases all together.? Everyone is releasing upgrades all at once, it takes some effort to keep up-to-date. [CodeRush 2.0](https://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/IDETools/CodeRush/Index.xml) - this is a major update to a great tool from Developer Express.? Coderush adds many nice single key command to insert code for you and cut down on coding time. [GhostDoc 1.9.5](https://www.roland-weigelt.de/ghostdoc/) - a great tool for commenting methods in my C# code has been released with a few bug fixes. This tool allows easy customization and is a Visual Studio add-in that just works and takes little memory. [Sourcegear Vault 3.5](https://www.sourcegear.com/vault/index.html) - a nice replacement for Microsoft's SourceSafe.? The tool has a nice integration with Visual Studio and a SQL backend.? The new version has some great new features. [Red Gate Software SQL Compare and SQL Data Compare 5.2](https://www.red-gate.com/products/index.htm)?- these tools save my life.? We don't have much in the way of automated SQL table and store procedure deployment and these tools do the trick for a quick way to get table changes out.
