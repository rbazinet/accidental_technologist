I have been doing a lot of C# development over the years and it has been my primary language since the days of C and C++ coding. I started working with Ruby for the past couple years doing personal projects and some client work too. It was an experience to learn Ruby after so long with C-type languages.

Unfortunately I did not have [CodeThinked](http://www.codethinked.com) to help me out. I discovered a great set of tutorials which show how to setup [IronRuby](http://ironruby.com/) and learn it based on what you know as a C# developer.

There are currently 6 separate posts up covering everything from getting from source, building and running Ruby applications to learning Ruby by comparing to constructs in C#. Great stuff!

Give them a read and start writing some Ruby.
