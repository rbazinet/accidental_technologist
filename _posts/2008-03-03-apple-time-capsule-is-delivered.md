Today was a great day when the Fed Ex driver showed up two days early with my [Apple Time Capsule](https://www.apple.com/timecapsule/). This is the best I can show right now:

I am going to be on the road for a couple days so I can't do the unboxing photos just yet but I will get to them when I get back. It will be a great moment getting it setup and running my first Time Machine backup.
