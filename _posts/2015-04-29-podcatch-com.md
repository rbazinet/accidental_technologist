[Dave Winer](https://scripting.com/) is always working on something new, something creative and innovative. While running out of something good to listen to Dave cam e up with [Podcatch.com](https://podcatch.com/), a curated list of podcasts from friends. > New shows from my friends' favorite feeds. That's what I need when I'm rushing to get out of the house and don't have time to load up my phone with good shows. I'm getting a lot more value for my podcast-listening time. And so can you!

 The list is if full of a variety of podcasts so there has to be something to catch your ear. ![2015 04 29 07 14 56](/assets/img/2015/04/2015-04-29_07-14-56.jpg "2015-04-29_07-14-56.jpg") I have already discovered a couple new podcasts to add to my Instacast client.
