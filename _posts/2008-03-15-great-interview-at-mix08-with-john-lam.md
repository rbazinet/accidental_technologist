[Aaron Junod](http://rubydoes.net/), my co-author of Professional IronRuby [I talked about already](http://rbazinet.wordpress.com/2008/03/14/professional-ironruby-coming-to-a-bookstore-near-you/), did a great interview with [John Lam](http://www.iunknown.com/) at the recent MIX conference in Las Vegas. Aaron asked some great questions and as always John answered them very openly giving all those [IronRuby](http://www.ironruby.net/) enthusiasts something to look forward to.

The interview covers a lot, including:

- IronRuby
- Microsoft and Open Source
- Microsoft working with Open Source developer community
- Future of IronRuby and the Microsoft dynamic languages
