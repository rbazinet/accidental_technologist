I had the opportunity to interview [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHH), [Ruby on Rails](https://www.rubyonrails.org/) creator, recently for [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/) and it went live today. I was very impressed with David's willingness to talk to me given the interview occurred right after the Rails 2.0 release. I am sure I was not the only one pursuing him for an interview at the time.
