I had a chance this weekend, while out Christmas shopping, to stop by my local Gamestop to check out the new XBOX 360. I have to say that this thing is incredible. I have an original XBOX and I think the graphics are really good comparing them to games on my PC but the new XBOX 360 blows both away.

I watch a couple people play Brothers in Arms on the 360 and watching how life-like the graphics are almost made me motion sick. The geek inside of me would really like to get a new XBOX 360 but since they are back-ordered everywhere I may wait to see what the new Sony PlayStation and Nintendo Revolution look like.
