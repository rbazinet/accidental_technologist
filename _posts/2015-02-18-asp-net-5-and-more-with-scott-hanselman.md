Microsoft has gotten a bad wrap for many years, I've done a fair amount of it myself. I think today's Microsoft has a very different public-facing gorilla than it used to be. [The MS Dev Show](http://msdevshow.com/2015/02/asp.net-5-and-more-with-scott-hanselman/) recently interviewed [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/), where?he was very open about Microsoft today and dealing with their detractors. Very good, very entertaining listen. It's really good to hear from Scott who has always been committed to moving things forward at Microsoft.
