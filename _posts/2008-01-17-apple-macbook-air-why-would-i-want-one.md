Apple took the covers off its new sub-notebook, [MacBook Air](https://www.apple.com/macbookair/),? at MacWorld 2008.? The rumors about the notebook were true and it appears leaking a bit of information here and there is Apple's style and works by creating a stir. [![design-displayair20080115-tm](https://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/design-displayair20080115-tm-thumb.jpg)](https://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/design-displayair20080115-tm.jpg) The notebook looks to be with the historical Apple style, very well thought out both on the outside and on the inside.

 It seems a bit pricey to me.? Could this be another early-adopter iPhone-like price that will drop to $1399 in a few months?? Who knows, but that is the real deal breaker for me. Also you can "upgrade" to the 64 GB Solid State drive for $999, for a total of $2798.? You could own a nice MacBook Pro for that price.? I did hear the drive from Seagate is $2500 but still, $999 for 16 GB less storage.? Is Solid State that much better than the drive included with the base model? I am sure there is a ton of reviews and opinions on the web about this system.? It certainly looks gorgeous, just not sure it will be worth the money at this point.? If I traveled all the time I may think differently, I will stick with my MacBook Pro. You can read about the reaction over on [TechCrunch who had a good-time knocking](https://www.techcrunch.com/2008/01/15/air-the-only-thing-left-in-your-wallet-after-you-buy-apples-new-laptop/) the new toy.? My guess is Apple will sell a ton of these just because the real diehard Apple followers will buy anything from Apple.? I am not that bad. <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" style="display:inline;margin:0;padding:0;">Technorati Tags: [Apple](https://technorati.com/tags/Apple), [MacBook Air](https://technorati.com/tags/MacBook%20Air)</div>
