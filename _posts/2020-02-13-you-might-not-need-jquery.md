This is a [really nice resource](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) for those moving from jQuery to JavaScript ES6. I like the 1:1 comparisons.

> jQuery and its cousins are great, and by all means use them if it makes it easier to develop your application. If you're developing a library on the other hand, please take a moment to consider if you actually need jQuery as a dependency. Maybe you can include a few lines of utility code, and forgo the requirement. If you're only targeting more modern browsers, you might not need anything more than what the browser ships with.
