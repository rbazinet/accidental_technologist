[![battle](https://www.accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/ADO.NETEntityFrameworkNoConfidenceArticl_843F/battle_thumb.jpg)](https://www.accidentaltechnologist.com/files/media/image/WindowsLiveWriter/ADO.NETEntityFrameworkNoConfidenceArticl_843F/battle_2.jpg) I wrote an article and published it today on [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com), called [ADO.NET Entity Framework Taking Some Heat](https://www.infoq.com/news/2008/06/entity-framework-heat). It is about the recent petition put out by some industry folks concerned about the soon-to-be-released version 1.0 of the framework, called [ADO .NET Entity Framework Vote of No Confidence](https://efvote.wufoo.com/forms/ado-net-entity-framework-vote-of-no-confidence/).

I was a little reluctant to published the article with fear of taking a side and not just reporting the facts. It is a good battle with two sides who are clearly passionate about their work.
