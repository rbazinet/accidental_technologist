The event will take place February 6 &amp; 7, 2009 in Orlando Florida at the [Ramada Orlando Celebration Resort &amp; Convention Center](http://www.ramadaorlandocelebration.com), located near all things Disney.

I attended the last acts\_as\_conference, had a great time and met many people. I intend on heading down this year as well to enjoy some more mingling and the warm Florida weather after enduring winter here in New England.
