In case you are like me and NOT at the PDC, Microsoft has obviously been making some big announcements. One announcement was around the new features planned for [C# 3.0](https://msdn.microsoft.com/vcsharp/future/)

The [LINQ Project](https://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/future/linq/) was also announced at the same time. This gives C# developers some language extensions. It appears this includes set operations, transform operations and some query technology. I am sure we will hear a lot more of this over the coming months.

UPDATE : Here is a great source on the [LINQ Project](https://objectsharp.com/blogs/barry/archive/2005/09/13/3395.aspx). It seems to be stirring quite a buzz.

On a side note, Microsoft has posted the Visual Studio 2005 RC1 to the MSDN Subscribers area. This is a big step in getting it in our hands. The interesting thing I noticed is the Beta 2 Go-live license is not supported with RC1. In my opinion this makes RC1 just another CTP.
