Windows Writer Zone has announced [Windows Live Writer is finally out of beta and available now](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!1442.entry) and is free.

Windows Live Writer is the tool I use to write this blog as well as craft the articles I write for [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/). I used several tools over the past couple years that I have blogged and none are as smooth and easy to use as Windows Live Writer. I think the user interface is what makes the product so nice to use.
