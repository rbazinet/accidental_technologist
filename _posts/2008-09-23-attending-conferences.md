Miles Burke has a really [great article on the SitePoint web site](http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2008/09/23/why-you-should-attend-two-conferences-a-year/) about attending conferences and the reasons to do so.

Miles points out two great reasons to attend a conference:

> Let’s start with education. You’ll learn more from attending one conference than all the books and blog posts you can read in one month. This may sound like a tall order, but seriously, if you are actively listening to the presenter, it’s hard not to learn more than by simply being there.

And:

> Then there’s the networking. Some may derisively call it schmoozing, however, this is a very important benefit of conferences that should not be underestimated. The contacts that you can make by grabbing a meal or a coffee during a break can be worth the cost of the conference alone. I’ve won at least $50,000 worth of business just by attending the last two Web Directions South conferences–and that’s without even really trying!

I agree wholeheartedly with these reasons. I attended only a couple conferences this year, both somewhat regional and single-track, which were fantastic. My attendance at both of these conferences has opened up a whole world of opportunities from making new friends to getting work from the folks I met and spent some time talking to.

I am a big fan of the smaller conferences which have 150-200 attendees and are single track. It is often hard to decide between sessions in a multi-session format and somehow you lose.

The two conferences I have left for the year will bring the total for me to 4, which is more than I normally attend. Since becoming an independent developer I find it more important now to attend conferences and network whenever possible.

Upcoming Conferences I am attending:

- Novemeber 6-8, 2008 [RubyConf 2008](http://rubyconf.org/) in Orlando, FL
- November 17-20, 2008 [Voices That Matter: Professional Ruby](http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ruby2008/) in Boston, MA
- Winter 2009 [Acts as Conference](http://www.actsasconference.com/) in Orlando, FL
