![RadRails.Jpg](https://rbazinet.files.wordpress.com/2006/02/RadRails.Jpg) I have been on a frenzy lately trying to find a good development environment for doing Rails development on Windows XP as well as on my Mac. I downloaded and unzipped [RadRails](https://www.radrails.org/) to see how well this environment works. RadRails is based on the opensource editor and development system Eclipse. It uses Eclipse as it's base and adds a Ruby editor called [RDT (Ruby Development Tools)](https://rubyeclipse.sourceforge.net/). This combination sounds like a great combination but I found the experience lack luster. I am able to create controllers, models and scaffolds from the system but didn't really see the value I was supposed to receive from using it. I am coming from a Visual Studio back ground and tought I might be seeing some VS-ish features such as "Intellisense", as in VS. Unless it was turned off by default then I must have missed it.? RDT does list auto completion as a feature but I did see it working as I expected. RadRails runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX, so it looks like a potentially nice Rails development system.? Has anyone been able to find completion or other features not a default in RadRails?
