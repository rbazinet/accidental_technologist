I have a few [Ruby on Rails](https://www.rubyonrails.org) applications I maintain outside of the commercial work I do. These applications are important to me but I have been very bad at keeping them in any source control until today.

I use [RailsPlayground](https://www.railsplayground.com/) with a VPS for my personal hosting and I have been very happy with the hosting and the service in particular. I started looking around for a free or cheap Subversion hosting source and was pleasantly surprised RailsPlayground provides this to their VPS clients.

Pretty decent specs compared to some of the paid-for Subversion hosting plans:

> Advanced Subversion and Trac Hosting
> 
> In addition to your normal webspace with our hosting plans you will receive a free account on our dedicated SVN and Trac Server with the following features.
> 
> \* 1 GB Disk Space  
> \* 10 GB Traffic  
> \* Unlimited repositories  
> \* Unlimited users for each repository  
> \* Trac installed automatically via our custom control panel  
> \* Your own Bugzilla instance by request  
> \* Nightly offsite backups  
> \* RAID 1 Data protection  
> \* Secure HTTPS and HTTP access to your svn repositories  
> \* Free with any of our current hosting packages.  
> \* Just send an email to support@railsplayground.com to request access to this service once you have signed up.

I sent an email to support and less than 1/2 hour later I had a new account in their Subversion system and ready to go. I am doing much of my Rails work on a MacBook Pro and Subversion from the command line has not been my favorite way to work. I guess I am used to TortoiseSVN on Windows.

Welcome [ZigVersion](https://zigzig.com/), a SubVersion client for the Mac from my good buddy Mike Gunderloy over at [A Fresh Cup](https://afreshcup.com/). A quick Twitter chat with Mike and I had the answer I was looking for, a great Subversion client for my Mac. The installation was trivial, as usual on the Mac, and connecting to my SubVersion repository was as well.

I simply added my project files via ZigVersion and checked in...done. The user interface is pretty sharp too.

I am going to use this for my personal projects, since the client is free, but I will also see how well this works over the long-term and may look to buy a license of ZigVersion for commercial work.

I am also looking at using [Git](https://git.or.cz/) since I was lucky enough to score an invite to [GitHub](https://github.com/) but I wanted to get something up fast and I am just get familiar with Git.
