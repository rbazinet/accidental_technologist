![EmberJS logo](/assets/img/2013/03/EmberJS-logo.jpg "EmberJS-logo.jpg") I [mentioned yesterday](http://accidentaltechnologist.com/javascript/and-the-winner-is-ember-js/) that I have been exploring various JavaScript MVC frameworks for both client and internal projects. ?[Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) is one of those frameworks. As part of my exploration, I have collected various resources on Ember.js and thought I'd share. ?This list is by no means exhaustive and I'm sure there are loads of other resources that I haven't discovered, add them to the comments and I will update this post. ## Getting Started with Ember.js
