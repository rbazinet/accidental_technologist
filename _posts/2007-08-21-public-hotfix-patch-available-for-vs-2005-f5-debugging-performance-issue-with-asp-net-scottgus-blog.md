Scott Guthrie [posted about a hotfix](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/08/21/public-hotfix-patch-available-for-vs-2005-f5-debugging-performance-issue-with-asp-net.aspx) available for VS 2005 to fix a performance issue when debugging ASP.NET applications by pressing F5 to start debugging.

This has been one of my pet peeves using ASP.NET debugging, the startup time is horrible. I originally thought it was some of the third-party controls I used and when I couldn't fix it, just assumed I would have to live with it. This has been over 3 years of use.

I hadn't realized this was a known bug by Microsoft and finding this information today is like found money. Yes, I am very happy indeed.
