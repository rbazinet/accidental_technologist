I have been spending a lot of my free time lately working on a new web application that I wanted to announce today, [CustomerFu](http://customerfu.com). CustomerFu is:

> CustomerFu is the simple solution for tracking customer complaints. A central place where all your complaints can be entered, actioned, monitored and closed.
> 
> Easy to use for anyone in your organization, CustomerFu will bring new discipline to your customer complaint management, enabling you to turn complaining customers into return customers.

CustomerFu can be used by many different types of industries, for example, the restaurant industry to track customer complaints by a central office by each of its locations. The system guarantees a complaint will not be lost. The system is designed to be simple and easy to use, yet powerful as outlined by the various parts.

### Dashboard

Users of CustomerFu have a centralized dashboard to track complaints coming in from each branch.
