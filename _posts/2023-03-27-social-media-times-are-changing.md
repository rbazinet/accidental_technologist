It has been interesting to follow the story of [Twitter](https://twitter.com) going from public company to being [purchased by Elon Musk](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html) for more money than I could ever imagine. Since that time it seems like you either love or hate Musk as the owner of a private Twitter. He’s a way better business person that I will ever be so I trust he has plans for the service that we will see over time.

Many people I followed on Twitter have moved on to other platforms.

I decided to explore the world beyond Twitter. You can find me in various places:

[Here of course](https://accidentaltechnologist.com), with plans to write more.

I finally created a Mastodon account over on [ruby.social](https://ruby.social). I am pretty sure I am the last holdout to create on. :-) [Follow me over there](https://ruby.social/@rbazinet)...

I started using the [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) account I’ve had some Manton created the service. I thought I started posting over there but it appears I never did. Thanks to Manton for getting me going again. I plan to write some smaller posts, useful notes or other short-form there. I can be found at [rbazinet.micro.blog](https://rbazinet.micro.blog/).

If I am missing some great community somewhere else, please let me know.
